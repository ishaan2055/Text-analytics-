loan interest rate was nominal but they offered fixed interest rate of  i have requested them to give floating interest i had taken the loan amount of rs lakhs for a tenure of ten years i had already completed  years and i am left with  years my savings account is with corporation bank and the bank has been the best for me as i have no issues in getting a cheque book or to complete a transaction online and at the bank they provide customer centric services and they been always responsive i am having the savings account with the corporation bank services is not good with them and i am having the account with them from the last five years of time the bank has to improve on its response and support customers well the service is not up to mark compared to the other banks i have faced so much of problems with the bank like whenever i swipe my debit card it is showing declined and sometimes when ever i use in atm it is shows insufficient funds i am having the savings account with the corporation bank services are good with them and i am having the account with them from the last six years of time  i initially used the net banking and it was useful it was easy for transfers and it was not chargeable online system with this is really secure what i regret with this bank is for updating mobile number or address or applying credit card have to visit bank they dont online application like other banks when ever i walked in with a query at corporation bank the staff has always been responsive to me they have always been supportive and provided me with the best of services though the bank does not have very convenient features online i am still happy about the support they provide on my savings account i have closed my home loan with the corporation bank and i have went ahead with them because of their interest rate  which is lesser one at that time the loan amount was disbursed to my account within fifteen to twenty days of time and the response was fine also there was no hassle with them my salary account was with corporation bank it is actually a zero balance account the bank has to improve on its response and support customers well the service is not up to mark compared to the other banksthey do not have the sufficient branches and atm available corporation bank is not even worth for single rating the bank does not have customer support at all which means their customer service is good for nothing they are not supportive to their customers also not giving proper response to the customer as well this review is about my corporation bank current account my transaction volume is around  to  lakhs ideally there are no charges levied for doing those transactions for example for cash withdrawal and deposit there were no charges taken even for a lump sum amount too since   i hold a savings account with corporation bank of india  minimum balance which needs to be maintained  here is around i dont wish to use internet banking i rather prefer to walk in to the branch also their staff were really helpful too i am with corporation bank for past two years for my savings account i never approached them for any kind of loans as well as they never provided any offers and benefits to my account but their net banking application is too good to use their overall service is quite satisfactory i have an account with corporation bank it is a savings account i am not using this account much for transaction purpose but i am just maintaining it they have a good features in net banking application it would be helpful for the people who had no time to visit the bank for any kind of request like cheque book request or for any transactional purpose frequently i wont use my corporation bank saving account much some time i do passbook transaction instead of doing debit card transaction corporation bank give genuine response  for all queries one month back i went to deposit the cash they immediately helped to finish my transaction without standing in a queue from corporation bank i have taken a personal loan i have salary account with them â\\xa0i am very much satisfied with this bank they offered approximately  rate of interest its quiet minimal when i compare to other banks bank was user friendly and the process was very fast they disbursed loan amount soonin  dec i have opted this loan of  laks and the emi was  the service provided was very good with corporation bank related to the personal loan process and the rate of interest was around  i have taken around  thousand rupees as capital and i am paying around  rupees as emi for a years time later i pre closed it later and they charged minimal amount for pre closure i am really happy by the service offered by corporation bank i hold a salary account with them the response is good at the bank they are helpful and cooperative they have also offers me loans everythingâ\\xa0 from  iam using this account customer service is good and the online banking facilities too i had opened saving account with the corporation bank long back almost it had been four years now the service is ok with them online banking facilities are available but i dont use i prefer going directly to the bank and the minimum balance to be maintained in this account is  the services at corporation bank is good i am holding salary account with them for past two years the online banking is also very friendly to use initially i was using internet banking everything later i had forgotten the password for which i am not using for retrieving my password later i had to  visit the bank for it i am having savings account with the corporation bank and the net banking facilities were very good but from the last one month of time it was not working properly i have made the transaction  but the money did not get credited to  the beneficiary account   response is good one with them before ten years i have education loan with corporation bank  my dad have applied the loan for my education we almost  waited three months to get the disbursement from the bank they were very slow on their process finally disbursement happened for rs  lakhs with the tenure of  years now my loan got closed without any hassles and i got my noc letter from the bank i managed to borrow   lakhs from corporation bank the process of business loan was as much as easy even there were no hassles in the documentation process the manager staffs of corporation bank was very very cooperative they  had offered an interest rate of  which was really satisfactory their overall services are too good i would say i had opened saving account with the corporation bank long back almost it had been four years they provide a good service to my savings account i do not have any hassles with them if i do not have any limitations to rate them i would like to rate them above  that much convenient it is to use i am maintaining savings account with corporation bank for five years the minimum amount should be maintained is  the limitation over the bank is we cannot expect customer service from them even the atm facilities are not wide and helpful everything seems to be  good at corporation bank the services they provide at the bank and the online services when it comes to  savings account the atms are also in a working condition always making it convenient for a customer but the debit card is not of good quality there are lot of scratches on it and it becomes difficult to use the same i had taken home loan on  corporation bank done very neat process on the initial stage but later when i approached them to get revised interest rate their response is not upto the mark and  their response time is very late to the customers queries i guess this corporation bank is not in existence any more to the best of my knowledge the prime reason for closing this account was because i dont even basic facilitates here for instance there are no online facilitiesmobile banking etc worst part even if had to withdraw funds i had to visit the bank in person also i had invested in fd initially later i had closed that too i am having salary account with the corporation bank and am with them from the last ten years of time services are good with them and the  net banking services are also working good  i would like to say that the customer service is also good with them i had taken my car loan from corporation bank documentation part is very easy and good based on my savings account  they had given very good offer for my car loan interest rate is  it is low when compared with other banks also they has disbursed my loan within  days  ever since  i am using this corporation  bank savings account minimum balance which needs to be maintained on this account is rs  online banking facilities are there however i dont utilize it though i basically operate this account for cash withdrawal and cash deposit too for the past  to  years iam maintain my salary account in the corporation bank i have not encountered any drawbacks with the bank and get good offers from them till now corporation bank has offered me home loan before but i wasnt interested in taking it because rate of interest was very high as i am working abroad i have sb account in corporation bank poonja arcade branch mangalore karnataka i was requested for internet banking  i have also filled a separate prescribed form for internet banking and attached along with this letter and requisite documents but poor  helpless bank manager refused to the internet banking facilities so i suggest you not to open an account in this bank and hope my review is helpfull to you you so much at the diamond district bangalore branch  there is an arrogant bank manager one interaction convinced me never to bank with corporation bank again my driver had an account and needed to withdraw money bank did not give him a cheque book and then refused to provide one after the money had been deposited citing lack of history  the bank had money in the branch there were no long queues their atm was dry  yet the manager just refused to help in fact i too requested to help in some way and was told curtly refused while he refused to give the driver a cheque book the manager also said there is no other way to withdraw the drivers own money and he has to wait for the atm to have money i am often told of how they discriminate at this branch so money deposited is stuck and the arrogant manager just refused to help in any way i had to lend money to the driver to sustain during those days  another bank opened the account for my driver and also gave a cheque book the service provided was very good with corporation bank related to the business loan processwhich was offered by our honorable prime minister of indiawhich was really helpful i have taken this loan on january and i have closed it in april customer service is good with the corporation bank i am happy to share a feedback for my own corporation bank current account the minimum balance  which needs to be maintained on my account is  i pay income tax returns on behalf of my clients with this bank internet banking facilities are also good i hold a savings account with corporation bank for more than  years and the banking services has been excellent the services they provide are very much customer friendly and the online banking is also easy to use and the atm centers are also satisfactory and i have suggested all my clients to open an account in corporation bank i hold a savings account with corporation bank and the banking services has been excellent the services they provide are very much customer friendly and the online banking is also easy to use and the atm centers are also satisfactory no hassles faced it was an average experience for the salary account corporation bank was fine but for the saving account still need an improvement service and response was also not up to the mark but i am fine about the phone banking and online banking services was good coporation mobile app was not good i wish them to  improve the overall services as customer friendly i am really satisfied with corporation bank i love the service very much not only for me its suits for all i would like to some other financial products also from same bank online service was good really good in corporation bank it was very convenient for usage the process of opening a savings account with corporation bank was not easy i had to stand in a long queue and they had a lot of process for it the good thing is i got the debit card the very next day and i started to use the same but they are yet to provide me the net banking i had applied for i use the services of corporation bank very rarely i maintain a savings account and they need a lot of more improvement in the customer support and could be more quicker in the response the online services are also average i could not do much on it corporation bank internet net banking facility was good they were provided some reward points for me based on my debit card transactions  still corporation bank atm has to be improved because there  atm was less but they would charge some amount for the cash withdrawal of other atms balance maintenance of corporation bank would  rupees very less transactions very less benefits therefore i did not wish to use my corporation bank savings  account i was holding this corporation bank account for more than  to  years backit is located at all rural areas my savings account is wit corporation bank and they have been very quick in their services when ever i place a request they complete it even before the committed period they work from  to  and they are not near to my office but still my banking gets done online and it is done swiftly they are excellent in the services and response quite some back i was holding a housing loan with corporation bank i had closed it now everything was done approriately i had got the title deeds and all my legal document from them on time the only area of improvement would be the interest rate as it was a bit high it would be great if they work on the interest rate and they had offered a high rate and it was a floating rate too  corporation bank is lagging behind when compared with icici and hdfc bank the website has got all kinds of offers and facilitates the facilitates provided by corporation is not in par with other banks i am holding this account for more than  years one amazing factor about this corporation bank account are the maintenance charges which are very less corporation bank was convenient because it was near to my home i could deposit my money whenever i was free even it was safe and good maintenance  even there were cheque deposit starts from  rupees onwards but from private banks they starts from  rupees for cheque deposit even i had been using netbanking it was good and comfortable i normally visit the bank for depositing cash which is my home branch it is my next to my place to what i know they do not charge any charges for cash depositing i am holding this account for a period of  years level of service offered by them was good as the staff responds appropriately and  i am satsiifed with thier reply too  my corporation bank savings account is a new account i am yet to use the service on this particular account i had colleagues who advised me to open this account the bank representatives came to my place and to open this account and they took my photo id address proof adhar card and  other photos of mine to open this account my savings account is with corporation bank the bank has been good in their services they have given me benefit of loans at a lower rate and charges though they have a lot of documentation involved the online features are really good and easy to use for my transactions i had applied for a personal loan with corporation bank simultaneously when i applied with hdb financial though the process took some time for the loan but i ended up paying a much lesser fee when compared to the hdb institution i only paid a total fee around  the rate of interest was also around  corporation bank is best suitable for  people residing at rural area especially in villages and other remote places at my native place i was unable to find icici and other banks however i can find this bank another plus point is nationalized  banks are more reliable and it is much secured too  first of all the services offered by the corporation bank is very slow as the transactions get delayed i only visit the bank for my needs i do not use the online facilities the atm features are good as they are all overmy salary account is with corporation bank and it was an average experience from them there is a clear way of showcasing my  transaction details  by corporation bank another interesting part about corporation bank is that there is no additional charges which is charged therefore it is  good to  bank with them for a savings account they also have a very friendly online services too i here with state that corporation bank provides very good credit card services there are certain  good features which is availiable on  the credit card  when i use  them i do not have to pay an annual fee for the same card there are loan facilities on the card but i have not tried them yet the card is accessible all over it  has a good limit  no technical issues while swiping it at any stores i hold a savings account with corporation bank in my native the services and response is very average if i need anything to do with regards to that bank i need to visit it personally from my current location but the bank could also be useful in future when i settle down at my native may be for loans and other benefits luckily neft  and imps fund  transfers are  not chargeable on  corporation bank and that is the best feature about the bank   i hold my previous salary account in this bank and i am completely satisfied with the services that was offered to me  i had a long relationship of  years with this bank my personal savings account is maintained in the corporation bank i just opened this account before a year and maintain a minimum balance of  every time   since the bank was near to my home i felt it is easy to have an account  this  account got activated in just  hours for the past  years i maintain my salary account in the corporation bank  i have not encountered any drawbacks with the bank and get good offers from them now and then interest rates and  customer care services of the bank are too good overall a good experience i would start off by saying that i am not a frequent user of my savings  account  and it is with corporation bank i just do savings alone by depositing money every now and then a minimum balance of  has to be maintained in my account   the bank helped me in issuing cheque book whenever  i required and i am associated with them for the past  years being the government organization  i got good response from corporation bank for the car loan when  i approached them directlywithin  days the loan disbursed after completing  the loan noc papers were sent on time door stop facility was given by the bank executive i just visited the bank only for the final process the lending rate for the  corporation bank was around  also the loan amount got disbursed within eight days of time because of due to personal issues from my end only documentation procedures are simple with them  and the processing charges were nil with them for about two or two and a half years i had a corporate account with corporation bank i had only used their branch banking at that time since the net banking facilities were not yet introduced they had very less atms and these days the atms and branches have mushroomed and are widespread now their customer service was very good and they had pretty competitive interest rates offered in comparison to the other market players it was a pleasant surprise at corporation bank for my car loan i thought it would be a long process when i applied but when i approached them the process was completed in couple of hours it was very easy paper work as well i got a interest rate of  floating where my principal in reduced on a monthly basis the processing charges was of  overall an excellent offer and experience overall corporation bank is a good bank where one could opt for  in opening an account  my salary account belongs to this bank  i use their net banking services most of the time to transfer money  with my experience  i would certainly recommend their services for all corporation bank is the best bank i recommend  as they approach to customer and always support for any queries  well behaved staff bank managers and staff always there for any help and support   customer satisfaction is their main motto  i was impressed by the service offered by corporation bank i hold a savings account with them the response is good at the bank they are helpful and cooperative they have also suggested insurances and mutual funds to me overall satisfactory to begin with  it was a pleasant experience of holding  a savings account with corporation bank as i have been holding it for the past  years the customer service is quite good and they have decent fees and charges being a public sector bank their coverage of atms and branches is good the average quarterly balance to be maintained is rs and the only point of concern is that they do not have a tie up with most corporates for a salary account i use a credit card with corporation bank it is a average card as it does not have emi options the credit limit is also average on the card they have the normal offers the credit limit is normal there is a annual fee taken for the card i would not wish to recommend this card to others the services are very much good with corporation bank i do not have to wait for long when i visit the bank it is very  fast they also have good online services which helps me complete my banking without hassles i earlier had a salary account with corporation bank and now i use it as a savings account my salary account has been with corporation bank for  long years now their customer service is really good and i hve never encountered any issues till now with my account the atm transactions are unlimited which is very convenient their usual rates and charges structure is very low they have a good coverage of atms and branches in and around my area i have a good rapport with my staff at my branch they are responsive and fast in their services they do have a net banking facility but i do not use the same overall it has been a satisfactory experiencemy salary account is with corporation bank and the  services are good accessibility of banks and branches are good with corporation bank for more than  years i am getting my salary credited through this account i would suggest them to improve the services offered to their existing customers banking facilities are rated neutral for the salary account i earlier had a salary account with corporation bank currently it is my savings account the services are average the response is average too they do have online facilities but i do not get to use the net banking overall average experience comparatively  the interest rate it is lesser with corporation  bank whereas the customer support online services has to be enhanced they require a number of paper works for processing the request i am a customer of the corporation bank and i am  holding a salary account for a period of  years previously  i was holding a  salary account with corporation bank their level of service is very good i got a faster response from them they managed to  open my account within  days though i have not used the services for long time it was only for a period of  six months however it was good i did not face any hurdles with them as such corporation bank is a good bank and this is a bank one could depend upon i availed a home loan from this bank interest rate offered to me was according to the market rate  whereas they asked for more documents unlike the private banks it was within a week duration my loan got credited to my account the only happiness which i am having in corporation bank is that my salary is credited in it  it is only average services the bank offers  they have only less atm facilities  and their services are not up to the mark it would be good if the bank takes good steps on improving its services my salary gets credited to corporation bank and it has been a smooth and hassle free experience for the past  yearstheir net banking and mobile banking are both very secure and user friendly and i use regularly for fund transfers and utility bill paymentsthe sms alerts are regular but charged at rs annuallythey offer  free atm transactions after which rs is charged per transaction inspite of having a savings account with cooperation bank i have a recurring deposit with them too the lock period is for  years and i am making rupees  as monthly payment the  offered interest rate of  is better and my rd is going good in the bank my savings account belongs to corporation bank being a traditional bank it has to work on their net banking services as they are not user friendly and fast the atmâs should be enhanced in number as they are less i am only maintaining a minimum balance of  i have opened a sevings account on bolpur branch  applied for atm card but  days the bank did not given me the card i have deposited a cheaque for clearing on  from bolpur to bolpur bank of india  but after  days amount did not credit  the amount bank of india shows the amount is cleared therefore i am not satisfied with their service as per my perspective the corporation bank provides normal services to customers  i am associated with this bank for only  months by maintaining a salary account i would also like to suggest this bank to others  as there is always a scope for improvement i give a four star rating  overall for a long period of  years my salary is credited in the corporation bank  i have a good experience with them all these years  their response time is very good and the bank even communicates with the customers well i can also find their atms in many cities and have no complaints my cooperation bank account is non operational  my housing loan is linked to this account i am holding this account for the past   years i have lost my login credentials with co operation bank therefore i am unable to access my online banking i am using this account for making fund transfer to my home loan  they have very less atms they are localized rate of interest offered by co operation bank for the housing loan is  they have not revised the interest rate as per rbi guidelines i wonder why they are not in line with rbi instructions i am holding this housing loan for the past  years installments  are much affordable they were able to process the loan within the stipulated time and the funds were realized on time i am using this co operation account savings account only for paying the two wheeler emi now the account is closed my emi is completed i am not interested in using this account any more i had account this open in the year  and it was there until  i had got cheque book and passbook only i am getting instant account from that  with corporation bank i do have savings account  from the last one year of time i have not much interacted with their customer service i have not used the online banking facilities and the minimum balance is nil with them when i have opted for neft there are some charges with co operation saral plus account whereas  with some other bank they are no charges this is a brand new account couple of transactions have made there they are holding different types of account there are many kind of savings account with them my major reason for opting it was because of personal accidental insurance cover of  lakhs at a fee of  per year  i am having the savings account with the corporation bank and the minimum balance is nil with them charges are nil with them and the response is  good with them i have not experienced the netbanking with them i am with them from the last six years of time the service provided was very good with corporation bank related to the personal loan processthey take around  to  of time to process the loanthe documents required are very huge but the sets and information are given in initial stage basically my savings account belongs to corporation bank  it is actually a zero balance account  the bank has to improve on its response and support customers well  it is difficult to take loan from the bank as there are more paper works involved in it i am holding this account for last i like the overall service provided related to the saving account with corporation bankthe customer service provided was very goodits a zero balance accountthey have not applied any additional charges in the account to me corporation bank is easily accessible  i am maintaining a savings account in the bank for the last  years  overall i  have a good experience with the bank  this bank is pretty fine without any drawbacks  as it is a savings account a minimum balance of  should be maintained my salary is credited in corporation bank for the last  years  customer services are good in this bank and that is the good thing about them  atmâs and online services are good too  this account is going very smooth and there are no problems

very good support from the bank executives and this made the process easier nri transactions can be done easily and so i got the savings account of corporation bank customer service is not up the mark  they will ask us to stand for a long time as they are a typical government bank moreover they will not care about the people as there are many constraints  otp facility is difficult to make transactions in order to get a loan from corporation bank only less paper works are needed  i have a savings account with this bank for more than  years  net banking options offered by this bank is pretty comfortable atm facilities are nice i would suggest the bank to improve on its mobile application disbursal was within one or two days with corporation bank  as i have a savings account with

loan process during emergencies especially on sundays there wonât be money in the atmâs the bank has to take some measures on this net banking facility of corporation bank was not that much good when compared to other banks more over there is only one atm network available in the greater noida location for more than  years  i was getting my salary credited through this account and it would be nice if they improvise their atm networks atm networks are not that much good with corporation bank since  i am maintaining the zero balance account with them when compared to other banks they are offering good service to the customers on reaching the branch it would be nice if they improvise their atm networks i hold a salary account with corporation bank the services are average the response is average too they are not very cooperative when i visit the branch there is a net banking facility but i do not use it the atm services are good i am not sure about the charges i am using the services

improvement in all the aspects i hold my salary account with them for a year be in their online services atm centers atm cards  and net banking facilities it needs improvement  customer support provided by the bank is also not up to the mark within fifteen days my home loan was disbursed by the corporation bank  the  property verification was smooth interest rate and processing fee charged were the best    paper works were fine response and service provided was great actually it is a salary account and service is not that good as the corporation bank is very slow in response they are not very aggressive they dont have better benefits rate of interest is less for loans they should learn from private banks as they use old format still corporation bank is convenient to me it holds my salary account for  years but my concern is i could find ample atmâ s centers in my city whereas in other places itâs very difficult to locate one when i searched in corporation bank website to avail a credit card i saw some eligibility norms after i reached the bank the executives explained me the set of norms which is not listed in website  i do have the salary account with the corporation bank

is very easy to access and i am happy with corporation bank this home loan is transferred from one person to me as no much interaction with corporation bank however the manager use to call me for any kind of problem and he took initiative during the process they assisted well rate is  for home loan and this is floating the service provided by the corporation bank was very good based on the home loanthey are quite slow in processing the loan to the customerthey are not providing any intimation or alerts about the loan process which is a drawback of corporation banks the service provided by corporation bank  was not good based on the account maintenance servicebeing a traditional bank they do respond in a very slow manner to the customer which is a drawbackthey dont apply any additional charges in the salary account maintenance the service provided was not good with corporation bank based on the salary account maintenancethey have  very less atm machines available within the city limitthe net banking system is really good with corporation bank based on the salary account maintenance corporation bank is fine for agriculture loanthey are asking multiple documents for home loan and response is low even for salary account holder like me presently i am not using the net banking as my account been deactivated as i havent used for a long time this savings account with corporation bank been opened by me in order to avail agriculture loan bank people collected necessary papers and they audited everything but no response later we can go with corporation bank only considering the rate as that would be less for any loans for my personal reasons i have opened an savings account with corporation bank we have small business which is running so wanted to do some transactions their net banking services was faster i am holding my savings account for the last five years with out any issues corporation bank  housing loan is good  i am very much happy with them  they were very fast and they helped in processing the request i am getting a waiver on the processing fee and that  the most promising feature of this particular loan overall the customer satisfaction was there they were doing it very fast i am holding this loan for a few days only frankly speaking i did not expect this sort of service from  this bank i am having the savings account with the corporation bank and am having it for more than seven years of time interest rate for my savings account is  good minimum balance is around  rupees to be maintained customer service is satisfied and net banking facilities are also good with them corporation bank savings account is not good because they are unable to provide loan when ever i approach themthe reason being they simple state that they can provide loan only for government employees and not for private employees i have closed down the account they are not providing any sort of benefits to its customers since  years i have been with corporation bank it is a gov bank and it is my salary account  i have not used any offer of this bank  charges are normal as the other banks they have to improve their customer service and should be very professional corporation bank is very good to the customers in banking services the charges which they are deducting will be an reasonable one but it would be helpful if they improvise on the customer services in future also they need to increase their bank branches and atm centers i had my salary account with corporation bank around  years they do not have the customer service centers there was no enough atm centers and bank branches available other bank atm usage charges needs to be avoided customer service is excellent and responsiveness more than satisfactory for past many years the corporation bank is doing good and they did not cause any issues corporation bank does not give any offers on the savings account attitude of the employees are soft and decent opened a new saving account with corporation bank they have eight types of account  in which i took the basic type for the maintenance amount of rs with cheque book and atm card  they have option of net banking   within a day the account got activated  compare to other bank the atm centers are less the manger and staffs  of the corporation bank   are good  in responsive  within  weeks the home loan was disbursed  interest  rate was   they require the simple  and legal document only  there is no need of any security  the only condition to take the loan is that we have to  open the account with their bank i had my salary account with corporation bank once but i closed this account with them because i changed my company and also there was no use to me it is an zero balance account only the atm centers are not sufficient in my city i was holding this account only for one year it is an corporate convince card which i got it from corporation  bank i am o k with the annual charges which is rupees  and there was also waiver offers is there i am getting my card bills and statements every month correctly they are doing well and every processing went smoothly i used this corporation bank account as a student and i have not faced any issue in the processthey required a  for account opening and no minimum balance required to maintain in the accountthey have applied nil charges in the corporation bank saving account for the past  months my salary is getting credited in the corporation bank the net banking facility takes a long time to load as soon as i get my salary i used to transfer all the amount to the hdfc bank account fund transfer is done with  hours for any other banks i am working as lic agent so commissions are getting transferred in this corporation bank benefits are very less interest rate is  for the savings account weekly one to twice i visit the branch of corporation bank i recommend people to open an account with corporation bank because they are doing good corporation bank savings account is fine it would be great if they reduce the charges they have to reduce the charges which levy for cash deposit its basically for all transactions be it any transaction if i deposit rs  they charge rs  and if the amount is more than one lakh they debit rs  and service taxes i am using  banks credit card out of which corporation bank is the only bank which charges the least interest rate its just one week now since i have used the card there is no drawback as such this card was issued after  months time this card is activated however i have not used still corporation personal loan rate of interest is very high i have taken a personal loan from them  i had taken  lakhs its an ongoing loan  no additional charges being charged they have only charged some processing fee  i am checking my statement online and the amount is debited from my salary account i was holding my salary account with corporation  bank for five years every once in three months they will send the account statements to me the additional charges was very less with them sms charges was bit high for every transactions mr subramani is the branch manager who is very good with me and still now i have contact with him corporation bank is somewhat better as customer service is good regarding loans they will not sanction as easily to their customers i tried for personal loan but they refused to sanction that only  is the interest for savings account they have to be liberal to customers i am getting salary on time my salary account is with corporation bank i am maintain this account for the past  years they were average in terms of service not too good it would be better if they improve their service and they should provide proper response corporation bank is a government banks so satisfied with the rate as that is very less for the home loan normally we can trust on nationalized banks as they will not cheat i am getting good response but personally have to visit interest is floating and that is good for me corporation bank is  very good bank and they are customer friendlythe documentation process is very fast with themthey do apply minimal charges in the account the net banking system is average and its not user friendly portal to access within based on the salary account maintenance the process in credit card service is quick in corporation bank and i have recently applied for this cardthe customer service is really goodthey do require minimal documents to process the cardthe credit limit offered by the bank was very good corporation bank is very customer friendly towards the customer in the car loan applicationthe response provided was quite late the interest rate applied was marginal rate and the charges applied were very nominal in this car loani will recommend about the service to others regarding the salary account i do not have any issues but they have less atmâs and i do not have any problem  the net banking facility is good service is excellent  only standard charges are applied as per rbi rules it is a good bank the minimum balance has to be maintained is  so it is good with corporation bank corporation bank is a typical government bank everything goes on it own pace  i have availed my home loan with them i found their interest rate and charges are less they have given a good deal since my builder had a tie up with this bank  apart from this there was no transparency no customer service i had to do manually they took  months for the disbursal  i feel corporation bank should improve in all the aspects and should be more transparent i do have the savings account with the corporation bank for the last  years of time which is my savings account netbanking facilities are good with them and mobile banking facilities too the response with the executives are proper to the customers with in three days i got my car loan from corporation bank the bank branch manager was very good to me i have taken it for the tenure of seven years which is for the loan amount  lakhs mr anil kumar prabu is the manager but he transferred now earlier i was a financial for mutual funds so i used this corporation bank savings account to receive my commissions moreover it is a nationalized bank and bank is near my residence staff are not proactive to the customers that should be avoided documentary part was huge in corporation bank they offered me  interest loan process was very slow when i compare to hdfc bank and axis bank corporation bank took around a month they should speed up their process in terms of personal loan i am associated with corporation bank for the past  years best thing is we need not to maintain any balance i am not much happy with their customer service and response as well each and very transaction i used to get alerts from them based on my salary account my account is in corporation  bank so  i got flat rate of interest and that is very less otherwise it will be very difficult to avail a car loan customer service and response is amazing for me the rate is  but to others it will be very high in corporation bank service charge is not there corporation account is opened for my family the facility is not that good with corporation bank  since it a nationalized bank i feel it is much secured  it would be better if they improve their customer service for loan  interest levied is very high and for two month i had to wait for loan once it is applied i feel this could be worked on so that it will be very helpful there are no service charges levied by the corporation bank since the branches are multiple there is no need to call the phone banking officer for any queries atm networks are good and well maintained i am delighted with their services for the past  years i am having the savings account with the corporation bank services are good with them and i am having the account with them from the last six years of time customer service is good  and the online banking facilities too i have got the personal loan with the corporation bank and the rate of interest was around  i have taken around  lakh rupees as capital and i am paying around  rupees as emi for  years of time i got the loan within  weeks of time my opinion is that corporation bank has to improve the customer service and the documentation for the loan should be hassle free  like the private banks  they use to call us and update us with the offer for a new cheque book they charge rs  for the debit card purchase we get some discounts interest rate offered for fixed deposit is   from corporation bank   i have taken  for three years tenure they have the activation charges  which is minimum depends  upon the tenure they fix the amount but the minimum amount  is rs appropriately  it is pretty good offer i have taken home loan with corporation bank so i opened this savings account however they are good in everything except the services  i am not seeing any kind of benefits from the bank no offers while accessing the debit card transactions are smooth as a government bank the corporation bank is little back in services other than the service they are fine with all the things they have taken atleast two and half months to clear the home loan as the service was too slow rate is quite similar with sbi so no issue in interest corportion bank fd was good i have been holding this fd for more than  years it was basically a long term plan  interest rate offered by them was good and there was no processing fee here as my mom is working there she advised me to invest here corporation bank dont have any benefits as if i deposit amount in the salary account for online i have to go the branch to fill the form and everything is complicated whenever i call them they have few options to speak to an executive and later we have to call the particular branch at times they charges badly banking experience with corporation bank is really very good  the customer service and the response is up to the mark  over all experience from the bank is good the atm services are pretty good they have more number of atmâs than other banks which is more easy for me from the last  years of time i am having the savings account with corporation bank minimum balance is around  rupees to be maintained customer service is not that much good with them net banking is excellent with them i have visited the corporation branch and the executives used to give the good response i would corporation bank savings account is really good i have got the account opened in one day i have raised a request the next day the account was opened and i donât have to run around for my cheque book or passbook it was that simple it was basically a corporate account and its was pretty simple and they were sending sms also if my average quarterly balance s low and advising me to maintain my balance i am a new to bank customer for corproation bank  i am using this account for a period of  i dont have much idea about them as its a new account i normally use their on line banking for utility bill payment and i like the look and the feel of the site however their website is very much complicated over draft limit is available with my salary account with corporation bank all the banking options are available online pass book update is the only reason for me to reach the branch i need to visit my home branch for any type of my banking queries my savings account is very good i am holding this savings account for a period of  i got immediate response from them  i have applied for the cheque book at the branch there is no charges for the same i guess they will provide the cheque book within  days of time nationalized banks will be good for car loan as they have part payment option corporation bank has charged me around  and that was not told to me according to me the deducted thing was hidden charge customer support is good and the interest rate is less so i took the loan for the last one year i am holding an salary account with corporation bank i personally opened this account with them there were enough atm machines and bank branches available in my city i also taken loan from this bank very recently i have taken my personal loan from corporation bank my sister in law is working as the bank manager there so i took this very easily from them based on the salary account they offered personal loan to me i do not find any difficulties with them i can say corporation bank services are not good with them and the minimum balance to maintain is around  to  rupees customer service is good with them in the branch and they can improve it rather than what they are right now i used to get the jewel loans very easily with them my showroom dealer has recommended me about corporation bank for the car loan because they have tie up with this bank so recommended me to me i have submitted the documents to the dealer itself rate of interest is  for my car loan my salary account is with corporation bank the services are excellent from them they respond very well it has been very satisfactory they also offer a good rate of interest there is also a net banking facility the facility is very convenient and useful there are no charges this service the service provided by corporation was good for saving accounti have chose this bank because its branch is situated very near to my localitythe response provided was very good to the customeri am really happy with the service provided by corporation bank corporation bank branch is located near to my property so i have taken this home loan from them i liked their services very much i do not find any difficulties with them since i am an account holder they assisted me very well my papers were clear because i am filling  itr regularly it was helped them to process it quickly there is very limited transaction made in the salary account i have got with corporation bankthey apply  for the  transaction made through the debit cardthey have less branch and atm machines available and they provide average customer service i was associated with corporation bank for almost seven years in holding my salary account with them they are very good in banking services and faster too so times there will be an net work issue other than this there was no issue with them on a day i can transfer up to one lakh rupees on my account corporation bank savings account is not that good the staff their is not  good as kotak and sbi i am holding this account for a period of  years there is no drawback or challenges as suchits basically a domestic card and they are not providing any preapproved loan or credit card as such i been  a saving account holder with the corporation bank from the last  to  years of time for getting the gold loan i got opened the account because the interest is low with them  customer service is good with them and i dint experience the online banking with them the best things are their promptness in service alerts are on time with them i have the home loan with the corporation bank initially it was  and after that it got reduced the services are good with them  after i submitted the papers i got the sanction letter after that i got the loan on the registration date with them my opinion about corporation bank is for getting cheque book the bank people will raise lot of questions adding to that  atm networks are very less and the daily transaction limit is very less  of the atm networks are not working properly and i am getting charges after  transactions i would suggest them either to increase the atm networks or to increase the daily withdrawal limit corporation bank savings account is fine i am holding this sa for a period of  years the minimum balance which needs to be maintained was rs  if we dont maintain that they will charge rs  as the penalty corporation bank response is good for the statement for the first  months there is no cost after  months some charges are applicable no proper customer service was  provided by corporation bank housing loan i cannot expect much service from them as it is  a government bank rate of interest offered by them was very less  the reason why i am taken a housing loan from corporation bank is because  i am holding an account with them thereby i had planned to move from corporation bank to icici bank i do have the savings account with the corporation bank for more than  to  years of time the services are good with them  the minimum balance is zero because its my company salary account charges are not okay with them because its on the little bit higher end i have opened my recurring deposit with corporation bank it was not much of a process the rate of interest offered on this account is satisfactory if i am to close the account before the maturity  period there would be a penalty charge taken my  savings account is with corporation bank their charges are pretty high on the processing charges the counter staff need to be more responsive to the customers the minimum balance to be maintained is of rs the net banking is very good  and fast there are nominal charges for the transfers my opinion about corporation bank is there is a drastic change in their services in the past  years since i am not using the net banking facility i am updating the pass books with them i am having a salary account with them for the past  years overall everything is good with  them corporation account rd is fine this was opened through the branch interest rate offered by them was one and the same expect for minor difference incase if i am planning to break the deposit i have to visit the branch for the same as i dont have an internet banking access for the same my salary account is with corporation bank the services are good i recently started to use the services it has just been four months the response has been very good the online facilities are good it is very convenient there are no charges for this account facilities it is a zero balance account corporation bank savings account is not that good the cheque which i have deposited was a post dated cheque the person  who was presenting my cheque did not check the date of the cheque and they have presented the cheque however it has got returned and its because of which they have charged rs  for the same corporation bank is always good based on their service in welcome kits they did not mention net banking facilities based on my saving account i need to maintain a minimum balance  they have to increase the branches and  atm in urban areas especially bangalore one of the reasons to open the savings account in corporation bank is their branch is near to my home and initially they were working even in sunday but not now for atm card usage i am paying  as annual fee managers of the corporation banks are very friendly in nature and incase the customers report any problem related to an account they give immediate resolution benefits of fixed deposit are quite similar to other bank interest rate differs depending on tenure period that customer select the interest rate normally ranges between  to  partial amount cannot be dropped in midst of the tenure but we can pre close that where corporation bank provides interest for that particular period corporation bank is good bank in overall whenever i walk in to the branch getting good assistance no negative feedback as such about corporation bank  on savings account they are giving interest of  to  several times i received a call from bank people for loan and if we request for the loan they process it in short time interest rate offered by corporation bank for the savings account is  quarterly i am not sure about the debit card annual fee  internet banking is great they do have net banking option and i am not getting any pre approved loans and credit cards  they do have a phone banking option and they have tpin as well my demat account got merged up with the corporation bank i do trading through one of the brokerage company the buying and selling brokerage are in the ratio of  and  ratio i do have the experience of  years trade its easy to access and transferring the money from demat to bank and bank account to demat is easy the money used to get reflected within a day of time no suggestions for corporation bank till now i did not faced issues for the past  based on my saving account need to maintain  per month recently i was applied for dd through net banking  and i got an immediate response from them i get average response provided by corporation bank for the saving account maintained because its a government bankthey donât response to customer even after visiting the branchi find the atm machines are available in a few numbersi would suggest it will be really good if they work on customer queries since  years i have a savings account with corporation bank i have received a good response every time even if the branch is crowded they take special care on me and solve my queries they are maintaining a good customer relationship atm centers and branches are available at many places compared to other nationalized banks corporation bank is the best one before  years i started asking for a personal loan in corporation bank i have never received a proper response from them every time the manager says that he is busy with some paper works and ignores me it will be better if they can finalize and inform me whether it is possible for them to offer me a loan it may save my time i feel that it is a better option from corporation bank  to take a gold loan they provide me the loan instantly the rate of interest is very less for  i have just paid  as interest it is very much comfortable compared to any bank for availing any type of financial products but the processing fee is little high best part in corperate bank is their service they were more co operative when i compare to sbi bank i would like to say this bank is better than sbi bank i am maintain a salary account with this bank and  is the minimum balance maintenance  net banking is fluctuating more than  years i am having a salary account with corporation bank the employees are very friendly and responsive to the customers and i am happy with their good response updation of pass book is still done in branches and e corp facility is also available with them i do have a saving account with corporation bank for last  and they have provided best serviceits really easy to access and  there is no difficulties in the servicethey do have many branches available for the customer and there atm machines are also high in numbersthey require a minimum balance of  in the accounti donât have any issue with the service and they do have car parking available in their branch my salary account is with corporation bank from july  i am holding an account with them  incase of any deposit the charges  levied is very high hence it has to be reduced  they provide very less interest their customer service is very neat and good  net banking facility is superb network of this bank has to be increase little more from corporation bank i have taken a personal loan i have salary account with them  they have collected all my documents and once i signed all the papers  they have sanctioned my loan in a weeks time the manager was very responsible with minimum precessing fee and charges they have sanctioned my loan  it was really good with them my opinion about corporation bank home loan is the processing time was quick and i got the loan amount disbursed within  days documentation was done by reaching the branch and there is no processing fees for the loan process the interest rate is fixed for first  years and floating for the remaining years emi is getting debited through net banking facility of other bank account corporation bank offered me a personal loan i am very much satisfied with this bank they offered approximately  rate of interest its quiet less when i compare to other banks bank was user friendly and the process was very fast they disbursed loan amount within  days corporation bank is fine to deal and it is a good bank in nationalized bank lists i like services of corporation bank almost of  years i am handling the salary account customer can avail vehicle loan home loan and other loans for savings account the interest is of  after five transaction of atm withdrawal they are charging some minimum charge i have the savings account with the corporation bank online banking is good and

the corporation bank the minimum lock in period is around  years and the rate of interest is around  per annum services are good with them they are not responsiveness towards the customers  i would like to suggest they should improve the response towards the customers i also have a fixed deposit with corporation bank the services are good from them i have not faced any issues yet i am happy with the rate of interest given by the bank they offer a interest rate of  it has only been a year with them for this fixed deposit they do no charge for this account not sure if there would be a penalty fee if i closed my account before the maturity period corporation bank is a very good bank in their services there are no branches at my place but when i do visit the branch it is good i rarely get to use it the rate of interest is of  i been banking with them for the last  years i do not get charged too for this savings account satisfactory services from them since  year i have been with corporation bank i have my salary account with them even their service is good i never visit the branch i use only the net banking facility  if necessary i visit the branch the response will be late but render a good service inps charges for each transaction is around  if possible the charges has to be waived off i am happy with this bank for saving minimum balance has to be maintained is  it good over all corporation bank is good my salary account is with corporation bank for the last one year their net banking services is not that easy as like private banks but they are providing a better service to their customers it is a zero balance account to me and their bank branches and atm centers are reachable it would nice if they improvise on customer services for the past  years i am holding my savings account with corporation bank since they are holding my   of my lic marketing shares i am logically holding the account with them i am having enough atm networks in my area and i am maintaining an average balance of  to  every month i am fulfilled with the facilities of corporation bank i am having the savings account with the corporation bank and am holding this account from the last one year   rupees is the minimum balance that should be maintained over there  rupees is the penalized amount if it falls below the minimum balance  they are having some conditions like we need to do transaction at least a time in quarterly and they are not giving the good support to the customers i took the mortgage loan with corporation bank the processing is very quick with them and i got the loan amount disbursed within  days even though they are not having sufficient executives from their end the verification and documentation was done properly from their end the interest rate is very low with them which is  corporation bank savings account service is not at all good they dont  know how to respond to the customers i normally use non  bank atm for cash withdrawal purpose and they charge about rs  to rs  as the charge i am holding this account for about  to  years as there was no proper response i have closed the account now i have taken a home loan from corporation bank as it is the nationalized bank so it has lots of work  they took more time for the approval but i am  happy with the service interest rate offered was  approximately   and waived off the processing

placing the request they refused to provide that stating only after  months they can provide a cheque leaf for crediting the salary they were charging about rs  for the same from corporation bank  i availed my home loan it was good with them everything was nice interest rate is  which is very less charges was zero percent hence satisfied with this bank  customer service was good they discussed about everything about loan and guided me very well only less documents were collected and within  days i got my loan amount corporation bank savings account is fine i have been  holding this account

banks  as customer no need to wait for a long time in branch for the queries as there is less queue so bank people are concentrating on their customers no additional benefits on this savings account

minimum balance to be maintained on the account is rs  which can be maintained easily by everyone i paid the consumer durable loan with bajaj finserv using this account fine experience with

with  years my dad was holding an account with the same bank based on which they had offered this loan no discounts was given  overall it was good its transparent no additional charges being charged its a nationalized bank and i place my trust in this bank two years back i availed a home loan from corporation bank it was a good experience with them very comfortable interest rate and charges  minimal paper work  in ten days my home loan got credited to my account service was good  no draw back as such i availed home loan with corporation bank as it is a gov bank i have not expected more the service was very good the bank manager was good interest rate is low i was not charged for the fee and charges i got the loan in  days i have no feed back back as such they are good on the year  i availed two wheeler loan from corporation bank on  the emi has been done it was not that god experience they took almost four weeks to process my loan the processing fee was high the loan amount was normal one customer service was okay i have a salary account with corporation bank i do not visit the branch much the services are good i mainly use the atm facility which is convenient and the net banking for fund transfers they online services are good there are charges but it is nominal they offer high rate of interest on loans the service provided by corporation bank was not that good as sbi and i felt it was on the average scalethis account was taken care by the company i workthey are not offering any special offers like credit card or home loan for the customer who maintain account with them for a long period of time i have a salary account with corporation bank the customer service is not so good with the bank atm are not available at many places the net banking is good they incur minimum charges from coperation bank i have taken home loan the loan which was approved within  days but i delayed to take the disbursement so it took  month very soon they completed the verificationpeople use to say that it is very difficult to take a home loan but i never felt that with coperation banksame interest  rate charged was nearly  which was less comparing with other banks and documentation was also easy i submitted all the documents in one shoti have also recommend the bank for home loan corporation bank is  pretty customer friendly as i took a home loan from them the manger named mr chandra sekar in the btm lay out branch was patience to answer my questionsthe loan disbursement was done in  days and it happened quick interest rate they gave was nominal as per market rate with   processing fees we can per closure the loan minimum  of after  years  without any extra charges i have  already recommended my brother for loan from the same bank corporation bank is customer oriented so whatever we require like loans they are ready to provide within  days they are adhering the commitments and promises branch banking is good in corporation bank than other nationalized banks only issue is hard to find atm centers otherwise online charges are nominal for salary account gold credit card of corporation bank is god and annual fee is nil we can use this credit card anywhere and interest rate on credit card is only of  per month billing cycle is of  days late payment charge is of  and service charge is of  corporation bank is good in all the terms its was really a very good service provided by corporation bank based on the saving account i havethe customer service provided was really good and net banking system is also goodthey have offered a interest rate of  for this insurance and they deduct less amount annually for having this account the service offered by the corporation bank was very good it took only  days for the loan to get disbursed and also the paper work was very easy their online facility is not that good as some of the facilities are not available in their online portal apart from this everything went on smooth and so there was no issues with the bank i have a salary account with corporation bank the services are excellent they are responsive to my queries i initially used the net banking and it was useful it was easy for transfers and it was not chargeable there are not much of benefits from this account but good services from them corporation bank is doing good so suggesting them to continue the same to avail jewel loan i have opened savings account with corporation bank because the interest rate is very less response is not up to the mark but they are very professional interest rate was  and the processing fee was rs  is normal in as other banksother than this it was a very bad experience with the customer service of corporation banks  so for each and everything i had to walking to the bank the customer service people will not respond the calls also  i feel that though it is a gov concern definitely they have to improve on their customer service should be more proactive they  should be backward in everything should be more professional even the bank manager should be more professional and well educated  it took  to  days for disbursement even this can be done little more faster within  week my personal loan was disbursed by corperation bankthe process was very easy with the lowest interest rate comparing with other banks processing fee charged was rs normal documents were required for the processi have already recommended the bank because of their quick process i took a housing loan  from corporation bank and they took  days for the disbursement documentation was easy being a housing loan interest rate charged was   with zero processing fee which was provided on basic of the offer  no customer service is given and i  directly went to the bank and done formalists comparatively to all other national bank s corporation bank is th best while availing educational loan from corporation bank the process was smooth but the rate of interest is bit high if we miss emi for three to four months post completion of graduation the bank is giving buffer period of one year to start the emi at that time corporation bank is the leading bank for loans now they improved well in technology wise as well before five years i took a housing loan from cooperation bank the disbursement took long time process for  months i submitted the required documents of the process and the documentation was completed within  dayinterest rate offered was  with zero processing fees i have a very good relationship with the employees of the bank and also recommended many people for the loan i have a salary account with the corporation bank and not been satisfied with the customer services of the bank  they need an improvement  in their service if i need to drop a cheque i need to go to my home branch which  is very inconvenient there are not much of atmâs and its difficult in an emergency they also charge for more than  transactions i do have one current account from corporation bank whereas nowadays nationalized banks are far better than the private banks they provided relevant services whenever i requested for any kind of query online banking was sufficient enough that even common people will be able to use the application corporation bank is near to my residence and my parents thought to deal with them for educational loan i was minor at that time so not sure about the interest rate but i think it should be normal i have submitted some education certificate like college fee structure and birth certificate bank is not well organized so it should be enhanced and there are only countable branches co operation bank bank housing loan is really good the best part about this loan is there is no processing fee charged for this loan interest rate offered by them was very attractive everything went on smoothly  on top of all that they have provided me an emi holiday for  months where i am not supposed to pay emi i am can take loan amount straight away corporation bank is a government sector bank and i am holding the savings account with them for the last  yearswhen compare to the fees and charges with other banks their minimum account opening fee is only their rate of interest also goodi can say that we can get promptness to the customer requirements my salary account was with different bank and recently of  ago switched over to corporation bank because they mentioned that there is loan mela post changing the account they asked for security  signature of any of existing account holder but i did not know any one as i am from different location staff of corporation bank were not pleasing and professional when i visited the branch to get statement even for a single signature they are charging high my salary goes to the corporation bank so i selected it for saving account and i guess the interest rate of  for saving account they are giving  of credit of overdraft so customer can withdraw the amount up to  though we have limit of  to view statements i am using internet banking online transaction charges are affordable as corporation bank is charges only of  rupees the service offered by the corporation bank for my home loan was not upto the mark it took  days of the loan to get disbursed there is no separate online portal available for this bank to resolve our queries as i had to visit their branch everytime the documentation process was of paper work and it took some time for the loan to get processed if you think private banks are those who change colors from sales to aftersales experience this bank is one you could better keep away i had used their services since  off late they are showing signs of mistrust i had taken a home loan in  at a floating rate of interest till around  they used to intimate the change of rates promptly thereafter they seem to have got into some kind of problem i have been experiencing a slew of issues with this bank and they do not seem to take any feedback at all blaming it on instructions from top  interest rate hikes are not informed to customers fail to revise rates when interest rates fall in market even after  years make mistakes in emi calculations charge you when switching schemes as against rbi instructions never respond to emails apparently head office has instructed branches to discourage emails from customers etc  so keep away from corporation bank from my personnel experience corporation bank is good for home loan as they provide all assistance and support for applying the home loan the bank itself is doing the verification process hence  chance to get approve if the documents is okay they will take the legalverification charges only after final approval of the loans even though  iam working  for this great hitech savy bank  my customer friends all over the country remember me  for the responsiveness and service  rendering by the dedicate staff   immense happiness satisfaction  and  be a member of corp bank family initially i had a salary account in corporation bank later i opted for a fixed deposit around  years back the rate of interest was  approx i would say that the services are better being a government bank they provide good services the lockin period is   years there are no preclosure charges this is my salary account and apart from that i dont know about the bank as no much experience with the bank maximum five transactions are allowed with other bank atm centers and the transaction charge will be  rupees of total amount post five transactions i received mails regarding payback points and offers but did not try for it corporation bank should increase the atm centers over cities because it is tough to find processes are simple for users and you can do lot of stuff online good bank to bank upon nice fixed deposit interest rates branches at most of the places so its easy to reach them very friendly staff and helpful loan approvals are not that easy  was holding a educational loan with corporation bank we have to provide atleast  or  documents and lot of other stuff to avail this loan this loan was taken to pursue higher education i was made to sign even an agreement form so that if i failed to repay the same they can even issue a legal notice against me eventually loan was closed successfully  as the dealer had a contract with corporation bank i did get the car loan from them interest rate is  with  as processing charges overall i liked the services and everything was quite satisfactory as well corporation bank has offered very good interest rate for fixed deposit and there are no hidden charges basis my entire experience really satisfied and appreciable customer service response is wonderful and getting proper follow up in terms of deposit i did open fixed deposit in corporation bank and it was good initially however it needs lots of improvement as the front office executives is not quite professional the maturity amount is quite beneficial and it would be better if they could respond to all queries corporation bank is very good in sending mobile alerts because i am getting instant mobile alerts post any transaction transactions are limited with other bank atmâs and they would charge rs while crossing limit of three transactions if we want to get cheque book need to visit branch and have to submit written statement for it where seems to be a long process however satisfied in salary account i am quite satisfied with the services from corporation bank for my savings account the fact that they were very prompt in providing the status very politely if there was any request registered by me normal online banking  no special features in that i guess they need some improvement on the customer service  i opened this savings account from corporation bank during my college days i need to create the online banking  customer care was very supportive for all queries  they dont have any clause to maintain the closing  corporation bank offered me  as credit limit in my master credit card i used to get lot of offers in petrol use and ticket bookings cash backs applicable for all types of transactions the best part was the approach from customer  i got one personal loan from corporation bank with around  of interest rate based on my salary account it was very easy for me to transfer the amount on monthly basis from my account i used this personal loan for my education purpose which has been referred through my own institution  overall good nowadays nationalized banks are far better than other private banks fund transfer in online banking was very easy  corporation bank offered me loans based on my salary account hence i took one personal loan from them  based on the rules and regulations they are working in their own parameters the rate of interest is around  to  which i feel to be high on fixed deposit corporation bank is good in customer service and responsiveness is also good overall i am glad about corporation bank as an existing customer for more than five years i think corporation bank has offered competitive rate and they disbursed the home loan amount within  days all the benefits like pre closure and part payment are available in corporation bank they are bit slow in process and no updates on time thus i followed them to get status however i am satisfied corporation bank is better than other banks why i am saying this is that they are giving privilege to the customers and whenever we do visit branch for any help they are responding good payment is one time and really customer service is satisfactory rate of interest is like around  i am happy with corporation bank fixed deposit i got this card and enjoying the low interest rate in the universe yeah i mean it i have used couple of other cards as well but never been so free from fault fees only thing is their website sucks you need to reach the branch to payout your bills i do have one current account from corporation bank whereas nowadays nationalized banks are far better than the private banks they provided relevant services whenever i requested for any kind of query  online banking was sufficient enough that even common people will be able to use the application i have taken a car loan from corporation bank this month i had a discussion with the bank multiple times and we were negotiating the rate of interest couple of times they called me multiple times and they convinced me giving the suitable rate of interest i met the manager of the bank personally and they did reduce the interest rate upto  there was a slight delay in processing due to some holidays in between however they managed to disburse my loan within  to  days of time it was a good experience with corporation bank in availing home loan this bank offered the loan for the joined account which is been linked with my brothers account interest rate is  with  as the processing fees pre payment option is available where there is no charges my salary account with corporation bank is for more than eight to nine years where i am receiving good response and customer service is good i am highly satisfied with online facilities because i am having android application for my passbook they are sending proper status on my account in regular basis i only concerned about my account because corporation bank is treating my salary account as saving account i am really satisfied with the payment option because payment option is flexible for me and i can do payment from  to  in the month recently i have availed fixed deposit with corporation bank  and online features are good the rate of interest on my fixed deposit is  but according to me the rate offered to me is low while comparing to other banks as corporation bank being a nationalized bank they could increase the rate of interest am quite ok with this corporation bank in terms of home loan however interest rate is quite higher so i am in a plan of loan transfer customer service representative are friendly however they dont interact with the customers which could be improvised initially they offered around  for  year and  for  years and now its  i do have one car loan from corporation bankresponse was very good i submitted only few documents even then they disbursed my loan within the time frame the interest rates are  least compared with other banks they have been charged  as processing fees  i never called their customer care since i am having the branch nest to my home i have planned to close the personal loan  with corporation bank as they have planned to shift my office to a new place it would be quite difficult for me to commute to the new place so far so good  every month the emi would be debited from my account automatically through standing instructions there is no hidden cost being added to the emi its quite transparent customer service was quite good and sufficient in corporation bank they offered me  for my home loan as interest rates which was quite good sometimes if i am unable to make the payment for  month they wont give much hassle even the officers are very polite whenever i am having any queries i got a very good interest rate from corporation bank so opted for this fixed deposit they do provide  interest rate which is impressive one i get customer friendly services from them i do cash deposits by visiting the branch where it gets done within few hours everything is best at corporation bank in terms of services and customer support only one thing is they are quite slower i do have existing relationship with this bank so it is easier to get personal loaninterest rate was  which was impressive and overall cooperative services my account is in corporation bank so it was easier to get the home loan interest rate was the same like hdfc ltd it was  and no processing fees only legal charges was there for verification loan amount was  lakhs and happy about the services no charges for pre closure but here the response is not much good in this bank due to my salary account was with corporation bank because of that i have applied one home loan  basically these private banks are not so keen on their customer services they should be more technically in terms and policies otherwise service part it was okay for me customer service was good in corporation bank my home loan was approved within  days basically all the banks charging the same interest rate payment not an issues online banking was feasible last  years i am dealing with no issues no suggestions for corporation bank the process was all done documentation is everything i went to corporation bank manager helped me throughout on a base rate interest rate is  though its a government bank i want to do documentation by myself there is no trouble as the manager is helpful i am holding a savings account of corporation bank for the past  years i can have an account maintaining very less minimum balance no extra charges for debit card and any other services i never defaulted any of my cheque hence everything is going smoothly i dont have any problem yet and customer service is good charges are very minimal it would be better if they speed up processing customer requests corporation bank saving account it was great cheque not used cash come i use to withdraw from atm service is excellent no issues in this  years customer service and manager response is immediate for any request any request they never use to ignore they are very helpful i am fully satisfied atm charges are applied   cooperative bank is ok not sometimes its satisfactory and the only thing they have very less working hours when compared with others my suggestion is bank should have a mini um of  hours as working only then the customer’s work would be done and they have their own working style and some part is good some times work is not completed on time i like the services of corporation bank and i am customer holding a savings account for the past three years net banking is very fast and bank is very flexible to their customers rate of interest on loans are very less customer service is good and i have no issue till now the processing documentation of this credit card was so superb and nice the credit limit offered is not much satisfied it could be enhanced i am using it for booking tickets in railways bus tickets etc i havent availed any discounts in this card and pay the bills through branch their services are perfect corporation bank saving account service is slow i am holding from  years best part its near to my home on line banking is not user friendly the thing is for any request i need to visit bank only on line banking is not flexible if their staffs are more co operative it will be great corporation bank is good i have been using it for the last  years now and i am currently not using it their rate of int erst and processing fee is less when compared with other banks when compared with other private banks its not that good and atms are pretty much normal its a nationalized bank basically they take a lot of time to respond when i approach them for any query and in fact they have debited the amount for ecs facility according to my view when we have a salary account ecs is free buy they charging us more when compared with other’s and i also have other accounts after getting credit to the other bank i am having my savings account in corporation bank where their customer service was really good i wont do much in online where the branch manager was really helpful in terms of documentation so far i havent face any hassle from them it would be really nice if they expand more number of atms and feasible in online banking corporation bank saving account service is good i am using from past  years atm facility is fine best thing i could say is they very co operative and helpful for any request process is very fast it was good experience i am satisfied with service corporation banks salary

rate of interest is nominal with adhara bank the customer service is average with  bank i have closed the educational loan with the andhra bank and their interest rate was around   the response is good one with them and their customer service is  not really up to the mark settlement procedures went in the nominal way andhara bank has many branches and they have good deposit machine in term of

good from andhara bank though i do many transaction with andhara bank salary  account they not willing to give personal loan for the salary holder i like online banking and atm service of bank its good but their branch response is not upto the mark they should work on it my experience with andhra bank was good as they are very good in providing immediate response and customer service was on time i have no remarks or inconvinence with o themi am having my saving account here i would like to recommend this account to  others and my over all rating is  out  i am holding andhra bank salary account for past eight years in my experience i felt service is really good online banking is very good and convenient to use it has all the options more over its very safe and  secured to use but so far i didnt earn any interest on my savings holding the andhra bank savings account for past  years i dont use the net banking with andhra bank savings account the customer service with andhra bank is not up to mark they need to improved their response part it is an below average account to use my savings account is eight years old with andhra bank there are no transactions over here i am just maintaining this account and i need to maintain a minimum balance in my account the banking services are average when compared to private banks i have five years of experience with andhra bank for savings accounts but i am unable to say that i am satisfied with andhra bank because the customer service is not at all helpful first of all their customer service number is not a valid one then if we try to reach their service they would not pick up the call i called them when i missed my debit card to block the card but the customer support did not pick my number and its because of which i am completely disappointed with their service even the branch is near  to my home but i never visit the bank at any cost i am not using net banking app with andhar bank also i never tried loans and credit cards with andhra bank i have my savings account with them for a year and the banking services are really good at andhra they provide good customer support to their customers andhra bank

good bank  my dad takes care off the debt  i had to repay the loan once after my course is completed or when i join the new company which ever is earlier i took home loan at  from andhra bank they gave  of interest it was nominal interest at the timei took home loan of rs lakhs to purchase the residential house still my loan is running without any hassle its a good bank recommend to all for home loan i maintain andhra bank for the past six years i have savings account over there and the services are ok i am not using the banking service much because i have savings account in one more bank so i never use the net banking app even the app is not much good i think service provided by andhra bank was very poor and the service provided  by them was bad as even the executives were not  and not upto the mark  we faced many  with andhra bank wheb i applied for the loan  andhra bank i hold  my salary account and they  fo  gurantors when i applied for loan which was  acceptable and i am very much  disappointed with their  and i am not intrested with andhra bank any  minimum maintenance balance should be five hundred at andhra bank so it is convenient for the customers to remain in a same bank customer service is ok which means average i had no issues with andhra till date they provide moderate service the andhra bank savings account is used very rarely  i hold the savings account with andhra bank for more than  years the customer service is good with andhra bank i dont use andhra bank net banking  instead i use with sbi  the atm facilities with andhra bank is very good and

last seven to eight years of time services are pretty good okay for me and the approach towards the customers  was not much centric and there is a way to dealt them i would like to suggest that they need to make the response in quick way and customer service too andhra bank is also good in credit card experience but there was no much benefits with this card they used to  take some maintenance charges and annual charges on credit card bills if i am not using my card for some particular limit hdfc is best in credit card experience compared to andhra bank it is very good banking system with andhra bank but the cheque book issues getting delayed with bank end there is no option to apply the cheque book via online portal the rate of interest and other charges are low with andhra bank i am holding this account for past  years i am using andhara bank savings account for about  years i dont use this account much the rate of interest and the fee and charges are high with this bank i am using andhara bank mobile application which is very easy to use and customer friendly i have savings account with andhra bank for so many years i am maintaining this account but i am not using this account much for transaction purpose the customer handling is quite good and they are responsive towards customer queries net banking app also good good i can view all the accounts in one page that is why  i  had chosen  this andhra bank fd i have online access too i  can  view and change  the mat instructions online i change  the principle amount  too i do get a the certificate of interest from them proactively on a yearly  andhra bank salary account is very good when ever we approach they resolve the query instantly my last visit to the branch was on t  march where i wanted to change my fd at that time i got a very good response from them my sincere advise for them would be increase  number of atms in my locality its a brand new credit card my wife was given a credit limit of  based on her pan  women account  which they have provided  without any request they have provided her a credit limit of  on her hdfc credit card i am expecting the same or better limit on my andhra bank too  i was shocked to see  my credit limit   as they have assigned only  i will not recommend this card because on my wife hdfc credit we have earned about  on our spending where as this options is not there in the above mentioned card all the documents were collected in one go by andhra bank and my loan was sanctioned in no minutes best of all they had provided the least rate of interest and it is a floating rate too on top of all that they did not collect any processing fees nor any charges too only concern with them was they were in need of a guarantor   andhra bank has not been good in their services they are not responsive too iam holding this account from my college daysthe customer service is also not good  and the minimum balance in this account is  at that time internet banking facility wasnt their i just opted this account because it was near to my home now iam planning to close it my savings account is with andhra bank and to what i used the online banking i would say that the details are jumbled and there are too many screens to swith over to make a transaction it is not user friendly unlike my other bank accounts the customer service is better with andhra bank i am holding savings account with them their net banking and mobile banking services are very convenient also i do not find any inconvenience with  their atm services i am getting good response from the bank on my queries andhra bank is good related to the saving account process from the past two years i was holding i have not used their debit card much hardly used in atm thats it if i need to drop some cash i directly have to visit the bank for it there is no drawback in the service offered to customer i am having salary account with andhra bank and the net banking facilities are  not really working well for me like i have made a request for that customer service is okay for me with the andhra bank and am having this account from the last three years of time i am happy with andhra bank i am having fixed deposit account with the andhra bank  and i have opened it there because its easy to access rate of interest is around  and the customer service is good with them i can withdraw the amount with them  at any time without any charges but interest will less depends up on the number of days customer service is good with the andhra bank i am having credit card with the andhra bank and the credit limit is also very good with them also i am not using it much customer service with the andhra bank is very good and am using it from the last one year of time  annual charges are nil with them but only insurance charges will be applicable they are debiting much amount while withdrawing the cash from the atm center i am using savings account with andhra bank for three years but i did not receive any kind of offers and benefits for my account but whenever i contact the customer care executives they are responding to me properly on my queries and addressing it the online services at andhra bank is not convenient at all unlike the private banks i need to visit the bank for every thing and submit a lot of documents for every process i hold a savings account and the banking services has not been up to the mark andhra bank is very  good when it comes to the savings accounts they are very much transparent with their details they provide information about all the products initially it was good now its not up to the mark i do hold this account with this bank for the past eight to nine years of time i am  customer of andra bank for more than seven yearsthe kind of service what they provide makes a customer feel they are valued and comfortable this account was opened when i was in college and i was forced to open now i am very much used to  this bank till now i have used their services i never faced any kind of disappointments with them andhra bank is a reputed bank i am banking with them for past  years i have taken two home loans from andhra bank one loan got closed and another loan is running they responded very well on application i have taken home loan amount of rs  lakhs with the floating interest rate  with tenure of  years i recently started using the services of andhra bank and the experience has been good the process of opening a savings account was very simple and i did not have to do much and the balance deposit to start off the account was also minimal the online banking is  also user friendly andhra bank is good  as a bank but the branch where i hold a savings account has not been up to the mark the manager is not customer centric and the process what they follow is not good i had asked for a personal loan once and i was asked to produce my property papers if i had those documents i would have taken a mortgage loan instead andhra bank acccount opening process is very easy i visited the branch with all the required documents and i had paid rs to open an account with the same bank they immediately opened a new account and gave a welcome kit balance maintenance would be rs monthly average   on the other hand the new atm which is installed recently is not up to the mark when compared with the old one as the older one is much better  after running from one bank to another bank this one act as a savior for opening an account with less balancethanks to the staff for their cooperative behaviour may god bless that lady who was helpful in every way and hoping from same kind of cooperation in the near future i am happy to hold my savings account with andhra bank for past  years this account was set up at my home town so they are providing user friendly services to customers but they should improve atm services for customers convenience because they are providing limited atm  also it has to be placed near to branch only otherwise all services are good when it comes to  andhra bank  i am the customer of andhra bank more than  years atm facilities are good in rural area in andhra pradesh   they are giving very customer friendly services branch banking services are good they had given the proper solution for customer queries they had provide hassle free services   even my andra bank savings account is fine  i was  using this account for only few days the service is not that great they have less number of banks around i  discontinued using that account though i thought of continuing with the account but later i stopped using that account for non operation they had charged around  for  months non usage and the charges are still lying in my account infact it was more than what it was earlier andhra bank customer care responsiveness was very very bad and in vanasthalipuram  bank staff was also not  giving proper response  to the customer very bad you should  give correct response to your customers  one of the waste bank  please improve your banking requirements as per your bank customers at least am saying should think i was holding my savings account andhra bank for past   years customer service was good in bank branch staffs are very customer friendly even the manager also deal the customers very friendly i wish to andhra bank should improve atm centers for customer convenient because they were not organized the atm center through area vise they provide atm center only in branch outside i was holding my credit card with andhra bank for past one year i didnt receive any offers on my credit cardbut i am using this credit card for general usage they were very transparent in statements i used to pay my bill amount directly to the branch i was taken my personal loan from andhra bank for few years back rate of interest was less compare to other banks my loan amount was  with  years of tenure it was done very smooth they gave me this loan based on m y salary account  overall they were provide good services for customers andhra banking experience was good especially internet services i am holding my salary account for past thirteen years if i visit to the nearest branch of andhra bank they shot out my queriesatm services and customer services was good  i was holding my saving account with andhara bank for past one year customer service was good since i didnt has no issue on my savings account atm service was good specially in our location atms were sufficient once i was tried for online transaction but it was closed overall service was good in simple words if you  have the local surety and local property within the bank limits andhra bank will provide an educational loan and they would be able to process the loan with ease it was taken for my brother and i was one who guaranteed it  as a guarantor i had given my id proof and i had signed for it it can be recommendable if they resource are availiable within the limit of the bank they can go for  andhra bank educational loan it is pretty competitive in terms of interest rate the interest rate offered by them was around base rate plus one percent they had asked for the grantor nor they did not ask for any collateral security which is  required for this loan  and its  ongoing no issues absolutely and i am yet to make the payment andhra bank savings account is very good no customer service provided properly online banking transaction is very good they are charging a lot of charges when it comes to online transaction i am holding this andhra bank account for about one year no issues absolutely  the customer service provided by the bank is not quick as  the number of staff s available are  very less especially when it comes to my home branch as such i dont hold a debit card of andhra bank and i dont have online access too i only use cheques for depositing and withdrawal  when ever i walk in to the branch they confirm that they have lots of issues they are unable to provide the debit card and they confirmed that they were unable to issue a debit card due to address issue i was holding my saving account with andra bank customer services was good they has provided  interest on my savings account but the andra bank branches are always crowdedi wish andra bank should improve branches and atm services fro customer convenient i really appreciate the andhra bank service was excellent my loan was in sundaram finance but andhra bank manger came to place helped to compare the various interest he himself help transfer them housing loan from sundaram finance to andhra bank without any charges and loan got transfered with the tenure of  years andhra bank savings account is very good  i am holding this account for the past  years the response provided by them was very good everything is the best there is no crowd in the bank when it comes to cash deposit i need to walk in to the branch and make the cash payment and there are no charges for the same absolutely andhra bank gold loan process is fine interest rate to be paid on a monthly basis when it comes to andhra bank i would be paying interest at the end of the term interest to be paid is  paise every month i had been holding this gold loan since  i used to park some amount with andhra bank every month as a rd  customer service offered by them was very good i am supposed to pay around  per month as the amount at the end of the term i will get one reminder from them confirming that the amount is going to get matured this andhra bank account was opened when i was a student its been a very long time now since i opened this account and it was before  years only after changing my company i stopped using my account  however my account is active till date  i never got a chance to apply for an educational loan at the branch as everything is done online i did not face any problem when it comes to loan tenure prelosure etc i am holding this educational loan for a period of  years there is no drawback nor any challenges till date i had to submit the land paper works for availing this educational loan the customer support  service of andhra bank is very good the rate of interest is also very good i am supposed to maintain a minimum balance of rs  and it is very much affordable too roughly around   atms i have in my locality and even my mother is holding an account with the same bank during my school days i had opened this andhra bank account it is a dormant account i am not operating this account at present  its a zero balance account too this account was specifically opened to get the scholarship amount to my account and the scholarship amount would be transferred  to my account if there is any my salary account is with andhra bank the customer services has always been excellent from them when i visit the bank the staff are very cordial and they have given me the benefit of a mediclaim policy the atm network are also and are every where let me start by saying that the builder has got a tie up with andra bank housing loan it was all well organized the property inspection valuation everything was done on time on the other hand there are two major short fall the first one would be they follow a manually process the second one would be the site which is outdated and old fashioned it would be great if they work on the above two drawbacks before a decade i had taken my educational loan from andhra during those days it was very difficult to get a loan because there was no online facility and one has to walk in to the branch directly for the personal loan  my father was the surety for my educational loan i had cleared the loan completely within  months after joining my job my andhra bank was opened at the time when i was a minor i have not utilized their services much this account was opened as the government will refund the amount if a person is a rank holder eventually it served the purpose i was a customer earlier of andhra bank the kind of services they provide makes a customer feel they are valued i had a salary account and the branch manager was also very helpful when i was need of help as long as i used their services i never faced

fast and they are customer friendly too andhra bank follows a conventional way of banking they are not up when it comes to technology technology wise they have to improve a lot the charges are quite similar to other banks also they dont provide upcoming offers they just stick to their old offers where as other banks come up with attractive schemes at regular intervals for instance sbi as sbi does that  the main attraction of andhra  bank is their online banking  i hold a salary account with them it is easy to get my estatements when ever i require the same the fund transfers are done through neft i visited the bank last week as my debit card was damaged andhra bank was smart enough to provide me a card with a general kit within two days to be used in emergency rather than making me to wait for  days for my name to be embossed on the card i appreciate andhra bank executives as they  are very keen about processing the  customers loan applicationthe support offered was good but i found it was a quite lengthy processthey took around  time to complete the processthey follow a economical range of support to be given to the customer when it comes to personal loan i am happy with

k hyderabad previously i had taken a car loan from andhra bank in  as they had quite competitive rates the process was very easy and hassle free they took just  hours to complete the loan process since i had a savings account with them it helped in easy processing of the loan as they already have my details andhra bank is good related to the saving account processthey require a minimum balance around  in the accountthere is no additional charges applied in the accounttheir debit card is acceptable everywherethere is no drawback in the service offered to customer being a government sector bank the services are average i get a slow response from andhra bank for the salary account they have good online services there are no charges taken for any kind of the facilities provided if i place a request for the cheque book it  taken ten days for me to receive it good overall the service provided was average with andhra bank related to the home loan process since its a government bankthey have got good technology but they do have a legacy mindsetthe rate applied was around  which was on the higher side and i may not recommend the service as well its not suitable card for this modern worldthey are not much convenient for the online offers which are available with other banksthe response and service provided was on the average scalethey apply annual fee around  in the credit card with andhra bank my salary gets deposited in the andhra bank i suggest the bank to be more responsive the bank has to improve on their customer support  when i call to the customer services and ask them any question they would say that they would contact  me back and later provide no calls  i have to directly visited the branch and explain the manager to sort out the issue i am a andhra bank account holder for the past  to  years of time i have not tried using the banks online facility and there are no negative comments about this bank but as per my experience i would like to suggest their services to others as well andhra bank offers a very competitive rate for gold loans being a public sector bank the interest rate is  which is compounded on a monthly basis i have taken it for a period of  year its renewed once in a year for which the processing fee is charged i prefer this bank for gold loans and have hence availed it i recently opened a savings account with andhra bank due to its proximity to my place about  months back since its easy access for any transaction i use their branch and atm banking alone they offer  free atm transactions they have quite good coverage of atms and since the staff is less there is quite good customer service they are good when it comes to taking gold loans as they offer very less rates past  years i have been working in andhra bank and they do give preferential rates and other perks being a staff the bank is specially known for their exemplary customer service be it any branch you walk into the net banking and mobile app is also easy and secure and i use it for all transactions like fund transfers utility bills phone bills and even income tax payments the sms alerts are free i maintain a joint savings account in  andhra bank the account holders are me and my wife a minimum rupees of  is required to open the account and to be maintained as a balance i find this bank beneficial as in other banks we need to keep a balance of

as well there are no charges taken for the account services it is a savings account with andhra bank andhra bank executives collected minimal documents as per the bank norms interest rate offered for

rate for the fixed deposit with the minimum lock in period of five years the minimum amount to start the plan is nearly rs there is no activation charged we can avail the plan by visiting the bank directly the minimum amount to maintain in the andhra bank  is rs  for the saving account if we go with cheque book and  atm card it is rs online  banking service is good only minimum amount is charged for the fund  transfer   five transactions   are free with  other bank atm depends upon the debit card features it also increased i have the andhra bank  credit card  for last two yearmy suggestion  to the bank is that they  have to introduce  the emi option  and also cash back offer  on the purchase  but the major  advantage is that there is no annul fee as it is cooperate card billing cycle and statements are good  i do have the savings account with the andhra bank and the response is good one with them i really can say that the customer service used to provide the good support and the online banking services are an average one with them i get good offers on my platinum visa credit card that i am having with the andhra bank the card is fine and the credit limit is fine too  overall it is a good card and could be also recommended to those who look for  i give  star for the overall rating i have taken a home loan through the andhra bank  this bank was recommended by  one of my colleague rate of interest availed was quite high and it could be negotiated  the processing of loan was very fast  as it got credited in my account within  days the customer service

charges in the accounti get the information in online itself i have a savings account with andhra bank i have been having it for the past  years i have not used their net banking or mobile banking yet i am comfortable with their branch banking services the minimum balance to be maintained is rs its been a hassle free experience so far and they have good atm coverage as well i hold a corporate salary account with andhra bank its a zero balance account and they offer only  free transactions after which they charge rs per transaction their net banking and mobile application facilities are both not user friendly and their site is down at times even their general fee structure and charges are just average i hold a corporate salary account with andhra bank its a zero balance account and they offer only  free transactions after which they charge rs per transaction their net banking and mobile application facilities are both not user friendly and their site is down at times even their general fee structure and charges are just average andhra bank has not been good in their services they are not responsive too they also do not have internet banking facilities not sure on the rate of interest but there are charges taken for the sms alerts and other savings account facilities i am  holding a saving account  with andhara bank for more than one  year  in case of any query we have to travel long time to the  bank which was the difficult  pat  atm centers are less  if we withdraw from  other  atm   they charge penalty depends upon the withdrawal amount so i am planning to close the coconut i have recently opened the accounti have taken this saving account because it was mandatory for joining in the accidental benefits provided for  through the yojna plan from presidenti will recommend the service to others for getting a account  i have been holding a salary account in andhra bank for the last  years  customer services are good in the bank  net banking facilities are fine and the money transaction process is very smooth the only issue i face in the bank is the atmâs fails to operate at some time andhra bank has been good in their services i been a customer of the bank for the last nine years for a savings account the net banking is available bit i do not make use of the same i visit the branch and they are very responsive overall a very good experience i maintain my savings account with andhra bank this bank is not convenient for me  the bank involves lot of paper works to get a atm card itself one has to give a request in the bank most of the time there wont be money in the atmâs even services are average too andhra bank has been good in their services i hold a savings account with them i need to maintain a minimum balance for this account the net banking portal is convenient there are no charges taken for the fund transfers very satisfactory overall i am having a saving account with andhra bank and they require a minimum balance of  in the accountthey have enough branches available in the localityits a hassle free process to maintain a account with themi get the general benefits of a account holder through the bank interest rate will be regulated according to the rbi norms the customer can blindly rely on them regarding the interest rate  verification was done thrice by the executives i felt  very secured in taking the home loan with andhra bank process was very much smooth with them the minimum balance to be maintained for the savings account is rs  for urban and rs  for rural customers as i am employee i am getting my salary credited through this account toll free number is available for the customer support of andhra bank customers i felt that andhra bank credit cards are far better than any other credit cards available in the market there are no extra charges levied on this platinum credit card whenever i get my increment in my salary i used to get the credit limit enhancement along with that my savings account is with andhra bank the services good they are cooperative at the bank but they have a lot of restrictions in the atm usage and there are normal charges taken for the account facilities  they do not have a net banking facility andhra bank is very cooperative but the rate of interest is very high  of rate is somewhat high for the home loan in all the aspects they are also good but rate seems high andhra bank has taken  thousand as charge for the home loan amount of  lakhs as an employee i can avail all loans at a better interest rate from andhra bank internet banking facility offered by them was pretty good more over they are having a good connectivity of atm networks since i joined this bank i am getting my salary credited through this account when compared to other banks the interest rate was pretty less with andhra bank credit card for more than  years i am having the platinum credit card with them i would suggest them to make the emi options more flexible for the transactions as i do visit the andhra bank ofteni used to make premium payments through cash for the life insurance policies the whole tenure for this policy is of  years and after the tenure period the policy holder will get cash back and medical benefits the response offered by the executives are very prompt though my salary account is changed to different banks i do receive the same response from the executives internet banking facility offered by them was good  with andhra bank and i am having account with them for past  years interest rate offered for the educational loan was pretty low loan was processed within  days i took this loan for my sonâs education and kept my house documents as collateral more over the response was quick from the andhra bank executives for the process i have the salary account with the andhra bank and am with them from the last five years of time response is very good with the andhra bank and i can say that every aspects are good with them response is very nice with the andhra bank i do have the savings  account with the andhra bank and am having it from the last six to seven years of time the services were good with them i would like to say that the response is immediate with the andhra bank i  have not maintained balance at the andhra bank and eventually the savings account got closed at the bank andhra bank is also good and i say this on my previous experience i used their services twelve years ago but even now i am satisfied with support my salary account belongs to andhra bank for  years i am not satisfied with the services of the bank once  rupees was deducted from my account i called the customer service and they are delaying the process i request the bank to establish more atmâs andhra bank is giving all facilities to the account holders also they are offering loans and credit cards to those who has a salary account as on my research i am happy because all the products are available at this bank innovative technique is the deposit machine they are improving in new technologies like others the minimum balance should  be around  rupees as the minimum balance with the andhra bank the customer service is an average one with them i am having the savings account with them andhra bank from the last five years of time my salary account is with andhra bank the services are good from them when i go to the branch the response is good the staff are very cooperative the rate of interest is good there are no charges taken for the account facilities there is a net banking service but i do not use it it has been satisfactory for the past  years i have my savings account with andhra bank a minimum balance of  needs to be maintained in this account i suggest this bank needs lot of improvement firstly the bank need to improve on their response atmâs should be enhanced and many branches should be opened only for savings i got the savings account when i was studying and no balance is required for this account i never tried for any products but andhra bank is good customer friendly they are online service is not that fine another important reason to have this account is that they offered insurance the service of andhra bank was very good and they are providing very convenient service to the customerthey require a minimum balance of  in the savings accountthey do have enough branches available in all areas which is a advantage about the bank the service provided was quite goodthe mobile banking system is good with andhra bank based on the saving accountthe money transferring option is comparatively easy with andhra bank when compared with icici bankonce the beneficiary is added the money can be transferred in the same momenti felt the customer service is average with this bank very good service is given by andhra bank  based  on the salaried  account they offfer loan and  credit card online banking facility is good within     hours  we can add  the new payee  if we do the fund transfer with other banks the charges  are nominal branches and atm networks are good within  two hours  andhra bank completed the documentation and disbursed the two wheeler loan  rate of interest and processing fee charged were nominal i visited the bank directly to get the loan  and got the good response till the loan get completed i have the savings account with the andhra bank from the last ten years of time customer service is better with them but they have to improve and the response is also the better one i dint used the net banking facilities with them as such and they used to give the regular alerts i am happy with andhra bank when i compare to canara bank andra bank is very good bank services provided by them was good for the past  years i am using their net banking it was very nice charges are not too much based on my saving account and i would recommend them i did not  face any issue with the andhra bank while taking the  home loani  easily approach with the  bank manager when i took the  loan before five year the interest rate   was high but now it has come down  the verification of the property   was fine but i feel that the sbi bank is better  i am using the salaried account service of andhar bank almost for seven years   if we call the customer service  the quiers  are solved quickly  which is the good part  they  not charge for any kind of facilities  it would be good i they give the  personal loan to the customer based on the account relationship  and  interest for the saving can be  increased  the service provided was excellent with andhra bank based on the salary accounti like the service and response providedthey do provided sms alert in the  immediate manner they do apply  for the sms charges in the annual basisthey have enough branches available in the bank for the past  years i am getting my salary credited through andhra bank atm networks are not available with them frequently even there are charges for using the net banking facility i would suggest them to improvise the net banking portal and to install multiple atm networks the personal loan process was very lengthy with andhra bank the loan amount was disbursed within one month they are asking for two guarantors that too government employees to sign the papers i would suggest them to get security sign from one person andhra bank need to change a lot as they dont give internet banking and if want that we have to submit letter by visiting the branch for each and everything  we have to go branch and that is inconvenient infact they are not providing better basic services for savings account users with the andhra bank  i have closed the business loan also the tenure got completed on  rupees their services  were average with them and i can say on that time i dint have any option response is not good with the andhra bank it took around two month of time to get the loan disbursed to my account andhra bank greet the customer very friendly when we got their branch for any assistance more over they treat their customers well i am getting all the benefits from andhra bank like persona loan and other thing in regards to my salary account everything is on track from the last two years of time i do have the andhra bank savings account and their customer service is average with them they need to diversify their branches across the city and the responsiveness is good with them i use andhra bank for my salary account i have been using it for the past  years i am okay with their service according to me i wish the bank to be fully automated the customer support of the bank is not up to the mark it would be great if they improve on it the account maintenance was very good in the andhra bank and they are responding to the customerthe interest rate applied for the saving account is around they are ready to offer the credit card for the saving account holders which is a advantage the service provided was very good with andhra bank based on the recurring depositthey are good in receiving the customer being a public sectorthey have good objection handlingthe interest rate applied for the recurring deposit was around  the service provided was good  with andhra bank based on the salary account maintenancethey do immediately respond to the customer in the bank visitthey are applying charges around  in the accountthey require a minimum  balance of  in the account really the rate of interest is very high no other banks will provide this kind of rate for the fixed deposit in the year of  the rate was  to  even now the andhra bank is providing the same rate compounding rate it is and they give it once in a year i have got the gold loan with the andhra bank and the rate of interest was around  per annum because its the agricultural based loan the loan amount got disbursed to my account within a day of time  customer service was good with them  and there are no issues i hold a savings account with andhra bank the services are very good they are very customer friendly when i visit the bank the response is good too but they take a lot of charges for every alert they send they also have good online services it is very user friendly there are normal charges for the transactions they are requiring a minimum balance of  in the account maintenancethe customer service provided was also averagethey have the required branches available for this bank so no issue on that casei may not recommend the service of andhra bank to others for account maintenance i bank with andhra bank for my salary account the services are good from them they are responsive too they have good net banking services there are no charges taken for the account facilities for the online fund transfers too i been banking with them for two years plus i have faced no issues andhra bank savings account response is slow and am having it from the last three years of time the services can be improved net banking facilities are average with them  and the response in the branch is not good with them i took my personal loan disbursed from andhra bank they are very fast in processing the loan in the initial days later on the process was bit slow and the loan amount was disbursed after a month the executives are not friendly with the customers and it would be nice if they behave politely with the customers i have been a customer to andhra bank since   i opened my first bank account here  later i opened icici bank account when i joined as a software professional  now when i compare both the banks these are the differences i observe between the two bank savings  andhra bank charges quarterly sms charges of  where as icici charges  andhra bank atm reliability and availability will not be more than   where as for icici it is more than  when it comes to transparency andhra bank does not give value to customer queries where as icici bank treats every customer as privileged customer i tried applying for my user id and password twice in andhra bank but still not able to get  where in icici i was able to login from day  andhra bank mostly deals with rural people who do not have much insight of what is going in and out of there account    no transparency at all i took a car loan in andhra bank in   i took  lakhs at  pa  which means i have to pay an emi of  but they quote the emi as   if you want to track the loan by logging online they dont give you your login details  till now i applied for online account twice but did not get any response very poor service i have my personal savings account with the andhra bank and am having it from the last twelve years of time five hundred and ten rupees is the minimum balance with them i used to have this account for emi payments and all mobile banking service is good and the regular alerts are also good they are having cash deposit machines  and the passbook printing machine the only best part about andhra bank with regards to home loan is that they have  the option of part payment immediately after taking up the loan and they provided me a very nominal rate of interest  also i was very happy that my loan amount got disbursed within  days of applying for the home loan they need to improve the web portal which i feel they are very much behind all the other banks i am having the credit card with the andhra bank  and the credit limit is around  rupees the services are okay with them because the interest is huge with them and am having it from the last one year of time the service provided was really good with andhra banki have used the account before  and at that time the service was really goodi have not faced any difficulties in the loan process with andhra banki may recommend the service of salary account maintenance i took the home loan with andhra  bank they approved  the loan within  days the delay was only because there was some deviation in the property interest rate charged was   when i took before five years and now it has been reduced to  the processing fee was  andhra bank housing loan is fine  it would be great if they improvise on their customer service i have called their customer service i we have to hold the line for a long time and their ivrs states that its under maintenance always however they have to do  maintenance during the night time or during the week end the service provided by andhra bank was very good based on the saving account maintenancethey do require a  minimum balance of  in the accountthey donât apply any additional charges in the accountthe customer service provided is not good interest rate offered by them was similar my fixed account is with andhar bank good thing is there is no lock in period and no restrictions also they allow us to withdrawal i had find one difficulties while closing this account on pre matured level so on that i did not get proper guidance from them i have an investment my saving account is with andhra bank for the past  years services provided by them was good we have to maintain  as minimum balance maintenance only thing is they have some hidden charges overall i am okay with them with my previous experience i would say that their staff are not good  they are not co operative they are basically arrogant the basic interaction with andhra  bank is not good i am  holding this account for a long time my wife is dealing with that  i have closed the account they should be very polite and they should know how to handle their customers the service provided by andhra bank was really good for the saving account maintenancethe service provided by the manager was really goodi donât have any idea about the interest rate appliedthey do require a minimum balance around  in the account andhra bank it is not that good since  year i am been with this andra bank they have a poor customer service recently i tried to apply for personal loan i was promised to collect the documents but they did not come to collect the document and response later andhra bank should improve in all the aspects i do not have any satisfaction no service was provide to me i am not happy with them at all i opened this savings account three years ago but not using very often as recently they introduced net banking as previously it was not there i did not face any issues if i dont access the savings account regularly andhra bank use to charge every month like  rupees per month while opening of an account i was told that this is zero balance account but later they told me to maintain some  to  i havenât faced any difficulties with andhra bank based on the salary account maintenancethe customer service provided by andhra bank was very goodthe works are done in timely basis with this particular bank and i will not recommend about this bank because i dont have enough knowledge about the service i been banking with the andhra bank from my college days as a savings account holder when i used the account i dont have the facilities like the atm facilities and all i used to visit branch for every aspects and nowadays they have improved my very first card offered by andhra bank credit limit offered by them was  on  on that period my salary was  within  we can purchase every thing on that time there is no hidden charges in andhra bank their service was always good i have taken some life insurance policies from andhra bank they are good in banking services i do not have any problems with them still now i am not using net banking facilities with them atm services was good and it was easy rateable the service provided by andhra bank was good based on the account maintenance and they have responded properly in the account maintenance with andhra bankthey donât require any minimal balance in the accounti was using that as the student account and no difficulties faced in the process their service was very prompt in terms of credit card i am holding master card from them for the past  years it a basic card i am getting lots of offers from andra bank credit limit offered by them was  i am not using much so that limit was enough for me andhra bank savings account is good the amount is fixed is rs  while opening the account it happend where my minimum balance has got reduced to zero its because of which they were debited certain amount from my account due tto which my balance has gone to negative balance no notification was provided by the bank as a savings account holder with the andhra bank i experienced as good customer service and the responsiveness are really bad with them also their rate of interest is huge with them like it was around  for the personal loan my opinion about andhra bank account it is a government bank and the response is very good their processing fee is very high  it is not as good as icici and sbi  their facilities are very goodtheir mobile application is okay and i can download the mobile application and the site is not fast the executives are not maintaining a rapport with the customers the atm networks of andhra bank are very limited in my area it would be nice if they provide a proper response to the customers i would suggest them to improvise the customer service i would say andhra bank personal loan process is not good they are not treating their customers well  they are not very good in customer services and they are not  doing well in all the aspects right from account opening till transaction  they are old fashioned and they are not friendly rate of interest is around  for recurring deposit deposit for women it is  and this is special discount andhra bank will not deduct any charges if we break the plan in middle of the tenure period we can break the plan but i have fixed for  years the services are not satisfactory with andhra bank i hold a  salary account with them the response is average from them the online facilities are not satisfactory too they do not have a imps transfer they charge for the debit card it is of rs  overall not been very satisfied recently i opened an savings account with andhra bank my spouse is working as an brach manger in this bank rupees  is the minimum balance need to be maintain with them i am using their debit card much andhra bank service is good the offers is also good the cash limit and credit limit is also good shopping offers are very good the petrol offers are not there they can give more offers on my platinum credit card which would be helpful to me for a gram of gold andhra bank is giving the best rate  of  in terms of gold loan i experienced the benefits of gold loan with them for  times interest rate is very normal and affordable by the applicants who were fetching their gold till now i never faced any issues with them internet banking is very good with andhra bank with whom i am having a savings account for past  years their services are excellent in all banking services like proving loans and also in responding to the applicants the maximum amount can be kept in this savings account is  i was associated with andhra bank for quite long time they are not good in customer services once i lost my debit card and i given my request to them for the new car but still now i did

to get the home loan with  andhra bankthey have taken  around a weeks time to process the loanthey have required very simple document in the loan processthe interest rate offered was around sbi have

minimum  rupees is the minimum balance needs to be maintained on this account their services is not good and atm services is also poor i got the educational loan with the andhra bank i am not sure about this because its before  to  years of time the rate of interest is around  to  which i guess service is good with them i paid bulk amount as  lakh per years  to settle this loan customer service is good with them my existing saving account is with andhra bank for the last six years we are unable to do any kind of transaction easily with them they do not have online facilities and there is no single branch bank in my city they have to improvise on the customers services there was no atm centers also i have applied for the personal loan with andhra bank very recently they have offered e  rate of interest which is very goos i am loyal customer to them so they have offered me best offers they have come for the verification so it will take another one week to get the loan amount andhra bank savings account is really good  i am holding this savings account for more than   years their internet banking is not that good its quite difficult to use it and i have to contact their branch if my password gets locked and they would reset the password within  to  days of time i have applied for the new password and it takes a lot of time  my savings account is with andhra bank the services are very good from them the response is good too from the bank they have good online services they do not charge for the fund transfers but they take atm charges yearly charges sms alerts charges the charges are minimal from them i previously had a account with andhra bank and i have closed the account because i donât feel its neededits basically a zero balance accounti havenât faced any issue in banking with this bankthe customer service provided was really good and they donât apply any charges in the account i was holding an savings account with andhra bank for almost  months my mother has an account with them so i also opened an savings account their bank atm centers were reachable in my city since the bank branch is located far away i closed this account for the past  years  i have account with andhra bank they have a very  nice  mobile application in which the money  transfer can be done within fraction of second which is not done in any other banks customer serve is very good  as executive  pick the call at the earliest online banking is not good so i would suggest they can improve  yearly once they would charge rs for the debit card cheque book and sms alerts andhra bank is offering   of interest rate for the fixed despot plan the minimum lock in period  months  which i have  also preferred for the same no extra charges for any activation we can do the process  through online  in which after the maturity period will get the amount directly to  the account my opinion is that they should give more interest rate for the fd plan my brother is working in andhra bank so i opened an salary account with them there bank atm centers and bank branches were reachable to me they are good in response and customer services i am holding this account for more than ten years i have a life time free credit card with andhra bank the services are good from them they respond well i do get all the cash back offers on the card but i do not get to use them the interest is average on the card i been using the card for the last five years andhra bank savings account is the best one which i can say service is also good with them and the bank is in my home town and i used to get the good response from them i am using this account from the last  years of time i do have a saving account with andhra bank and the service provided is averagei am unable to raise a request for getting a fixed deposit through online because they donât have that option availablei feel the service provided is quite poor compared with icici bankthey require a very minimum balance to be maintained in the account i would say andhra bank savings account is neither  good nor bad i am holding this savings account for a period of  years however they charge me if i use it for retail transactions and for cash withdrawal they are charging certain amount and that was the main reason why i am looking out for a credit card andhra bank two wheeler was asking for too many proof which was not required at all first of all they were asking for surety also they were asking for neighbor reference or  or  reference of the government employee which is not required at all they can might as well ask for employer reference  my property dealer has tie up with andhra bank and via my dealer i have applied for home loan to andhra bank documents were collected on time from me and application is under process bank offered me loan as per my requirement and even the interest rate applicable is at par with the market i opened a account with andhra bank because i was about to take a home loan with the banki havenât contacted their customer servicethey keep on deduct the charges in the account for every six month oncethey do apply hidden charges for this accounti will not recommend about andhra bank to others for account maintenance andhra bank credit card is not giving any offers i expect rate of interest should be reduced from them  they are not giving any offers to me and i will pay the money through the demand draft i am using this card from the last   years and am okay with this bank andhra bank is good in their services the response is good the net banking is good too it is convenient and user friendly the rate of interest is average there are no much of charges for this account been banking with them for the last three years it has been a good i have not faced any issues for this savings account andhra bank is offering fixed deposit with the interest rate of    with the  minimum lock in period of   monthsno activation charge  interest will be reduce in case we  break the plan before the  maturity period  to liquid the cash we have to visit the bank  they have to improve the customer support i am a customer of he bank since  banks service either private sector or public sector is excellent through out all the branches when ever i visit branch am received very well by staff whether known to me or not a good bank  with a good track record am share holder of the bank also i andhra bank offered me a car loan with  rate of interest and its quiet less compare to other banks process was good and they accept the negotiation and i am happy with their service ï»¿i have got proper response in the branches they resolve the queries immediately my existing savings account is with andhra bank for a quite long time their net banking services was excellent the bank manager is very close to my family i located in delhi there were enough atm centers and bank branches were available i suggest that every one should open an account with this bank my home loan was taken from andhra bank i will call it as a golden bank to me because they processed my application with in  day to me basically i am from andhra pradesh so i always preferred this bank rate of interest is very less with them when compared with other banks i donât like andhra bank right from their internet banking as i forgot the password where i need to walk in their branch to place a request if i visit the branch they ask to come back with correct documents it is hassle process with andhra bank as for anything we need to submit written application start copying from private sectors and andhra bank can implement great thing to salary account holders andhra bank education loan is okay there is no need to pay the emi until i get the job they were providing some buffer period for that and this was the case before  years i am not sure about the current scenario interest rate offered by them was fine  this loan was taken for a peirod of one year from  the last one year am holding the andhra bank savings account  they are not good in service towards the customers i would like to suggest they should study the records of the customers and provide the best offers to the customers not only andhra bank every bank is following the same my salary account is with andhra bank for the past  and i never reach the customer service but the response from the bank end was really good i am also maintain a different saving account with same bank for that minimum balance maintenance was rs  and i am satisfied with their service i got the personal loan with andhra bank and i am maintain a salary account with same bank so the rate of interest offered by them was  and  was processing charges compare to other bank its good after completed  they will allow to make a part payment andhra bank executives responded very quickly  if we faced any of the issues over there customer service is good with them and am using this savings account with the andhra bank for the last  to  years of time  branch services are good with them since  i  am having  a zero balance account with andhra bank the net banking facility is not so convenient and while making fund transfer it is asking for otp and two different passwords for security purposes it would be better if they ask for either otp or passwords for making transactions i would suggest them to install multiple atm networks for andhra bank the services at the bank are average at andhra bank i do not get to use their online facilities the branch response is good the facilities for the atm is good i need to maintain a minimum of rs  there are no charges for this account if they charge it would be very minimal my home loan is in the process with andra bank  the documentation and evaluation was done it is in the final stage now i am joint account with my parents i deal with the bank manager he was very helpful till now and already few of my family members have taken  loan through him as per the discussion i found the interest rate what they offer is normal the pre closure is done without any charges it going on smoothly with andra bank the service provided by andhra bank based on the salary account was goodi do maintain my saving account with the same bankthey require a minimum balance of  to be maintained in the accountthey do apply some charges for cheque leavesatm charges and yearly charges as wellthey do have limited atm machines i had a very poor experience with andhra bank based on the home loanthey said i will be getting a top pop loan for the other two floor built but they havenât provide the sametheir executives are rude towards the customer and the charges applied is quite high i am holding the savings account with the andhra bank for the long time they are very responsive with them they are offering the loans for me and i have not taken that services are good with them and they are sending the regular alerts and am happy with them glad in banking with andhra bank as transaction charges for savings account are very less and no negative comments as fantastic services in my experience of five years no issues cheque deposits are getting cleared immediately and net banking is very fast overall i am very happy with this bank andra bank savings account is good they have less number of atms their mobile banking is good they keep sending mobile updates through sms  i am getting updates from them on a timely basis their atm cash withdrawal service is too high when compared with others i have  been holding this account for a period of  years and customer service was okay andra bank savings account is good they have less number of atms their mobile banking is good they keep sending mobile updates through sms  i am getting updates from them on a timely basis their atm cash withdrawal service is too high when compared with others i have  been holding this account for a period of  years and customer service was okay andhra bank is fine for savings account and did not use much as just maintaining andhra bank is in our village and felt comfortable to open so that i opened with them response was very good and everything was fine if we take cheque book have to pay  and if debit card is just enough then  is the minimum balance i have a savings account with andhra bank i am banking with them for about six years the services are very moderate they offer a rate of interest of  i need to maintain a minimum of rs  they do not charge much they take a minimum of rs  for their services offered ï»¿i have an existing saving account with andhra bank for the past  years multiple atm centers are available in my place and the home branch is also good they were cooperative it would suggest and appreciate if other banks also have deposit machines like andhra bank my opinion about andra bank savings account is fine i got the debit card and other deliverables on hand quickly after opening the account i have been holding this account for a period of  months and the best part is i am getting alerts for cheque which is being presented or if its under process and also if its getting cleared they have also provided pass book also and they have asked me for the introduction as well however no one was there to provide introduction i was holding a saving  account with andhra bank for the past  the major reason i closed the account was that there are  no more branches and atm centers available in case the atm are there maximum number  of time there is the problem in the  centerthe customer service is also  not good and the net banking is not available main reason to maintain the savings account of andhra bank is to pay emi for my consumer durable loan at the start it was like a salary account and later i transfered in to savings account by investing  rupees andhra bank had offered me some insurance scheme at the start through this account but no idea about the status of that insurance now i had taken a gold loan with andra bank interest rate offered by them was  paise which was charged on a monthly basis i have pledged my jewels i had taken cash against that  i have been holding this gold loan for about  to  months and i did not produce any documents for collecting the gold i have provided the jewelery bill for getting this loan and i had got  of the amount the visa platinum credit card from andhra bank is good it is a very old card with this bank and the benefits are not that good i use this card to purchase some electronic goods like oven mobiles and also for shopping purpose i donât get any points for the transactions i do with this card since  i have the saving account with andhra bank we have to maintain rs as minimum balanceonly  transaction are free with other banks through the atm and after that there is a penalty charge of rs for  per transactionon each and every location there is the atm centers the response is good from the customer service as one i approached them for my password query they solved the issue at the earliest i am having the salary account with the  andhra bank online banking is not goodfirst among they need to increase the number of staffs and they need

a certain amount of limit i have a savings account with andhra bank i donât do more transactions with this bank the atm facility is good it can be found at many places i use net banking much for online purchases  it is good to use a minimum balance rs  should be maintained in the account andhra bank provided me a home loan of rs  lakhs with an interest rate of  the processing fee was also nominal the customer service is excellent as they processed my loan in just  day my builder took care of everything i just prepared my documents and remaining things my builder had a follow up with

experience with central bank of india i dont have to visit the branch as i mostly complete my transactions online i normally use the online funds transfer i am holding this account for a period of  years it has good number of branches and atms its a zero balance  got the central bank of india savings account for past  years i got opened this account with the helpof womens federation the customer support and the response part is good with central bank of india the net banking and the mobile applicaiton is not used with central bank of india i had taken a home loan from central bank the service will be very good the interest rate was   which is fine compare to market value the customer service was very nice they took only two days to process my loan service it was been a very good experience with central bank for my home loan service the rate of interest offered from central bank for my personal loan service was   which is very low compare to others in the market the documents have been collected from my door step and the payments where deducted from my savings account overall it was a very good experience from central bank for my personal loan service i been banking with central bank of india for the last two months it was a easy process to get the account and a proper service at the bank it is a savings account and it has been good till date i get a response when i approach them and i am happy with the experience the service was very good from  central bank for my savings account even the transaction was good but the online net banking application was not user friendly they need to check with that  from central bank offers i wont use much totally the service from central bank for my savings account was excellent it was my first savings account which have been taken on  central bank branch staffs are very good also the transaction was fast and i have atm facilities nearby my location so i am very much happy with the service from central bank for my savings account service from central bank for my savings account was very good but till now i never get any offer from central bank also their application is not user friendly it needs to be updated some more but the branch staffs are good also i have atms for my savings account in nearby my location so i would say it was a very good service  i have been in a rural region for the past three years and have my saving account from that time with central bank of india i felt the bank to be little slower when compared to big private banks in india and also to be understaffed but the good thing about this bank is that it has a huge network of branches even in the rural most part of the country i feel central bank needs to be more digitized and they need to improve their net banking facilities also the central bank atmosphere is not much as i expected from central bank and i have been using my central bank savings account for the past  years still their service is same i feel central bank needs to be updated some more in their service this is a pretty good bank to have your saving account fixed onto i felt the bank has a very good facility and network the process are pretty good and fast i believe this is one of the best government bank in india with vast services and smoothly running staffs i hold a central bank of india savings account for past  the customer support is very good with central bank of india i dont use the net banking or mobile application  the atm facility and the bank branches are very good with central bank of india i hold a savings account with cbi bank and banking with them has been smooth as they are very customer friendly and supportive at the bank services the online banking is also helpful to do most of the banking needs the only drawback is they have not given much importance for net banking which is really difficult service from central bank is good  the  mobile application is  user friendly and easy to use  still the transaction is fast and i have atm facilities nearby my location i feel the overall service of central bank is average for my savings account  i would say the service is good even the rate of interest was fine the process and the representatives are very helpful and responsible so i can say their service is good from central bank for my home loan service till now there is no issue till now i would say it is an good account to use with central bank of india because the customer service is good here they give better  response to the customers the net banking and the mobile application is easy to use and user friendly with central bank of india i have got the personal loan from central bank of india around  agothey have disbursed my loan amount within  of time they have me more than the required loan

convenient time i can close the deposit and definitely the bank will deduct some penalty  for it nationalized banks will be better for deposits i have closed the educational loan with the central bank of india and the interest rate was around  the services were average with them because there is no  transparency and the customer service is not flexible with them my salary account is from central

overall it is good i have faced no hassles there are normal charges for the atm services i am having the savings account with the central bank of india and am having it from the last  years of time net banking facilities are  good with them and the response  is good with them  customer service is providing information for the customers i am having the salary account with the central bank of india online banking is okay with them like its secured way they are sending the regular alerts to me and the personal loan is available with them but  i am not interested to go ahead with them my property builder is internally linked with central bank of india so i was supposed to home loan and the interest rate is  as this is floating so it might change in future i have submitted all the papers and expecting for loan amount the central bank service is really  better compared with canara bankthey are responding to the customer in a very good mannerthe cheque entry process are done in a

around  for the loanthe customer service provided by central bank was good the process was very good with central bank when i applied for a home loanthe manager was able to explain me clearly about the steps of the loanthe interest rate applied for the loan was around  for the home loan application with central bank central bank educational loan is fine grace period was for a period of  years after  years i have repaid the loan completely  this loan is closed my feedback would be  i had to submit lot of mortgage documents for availing this loan and i had to speak with lot of seniors and for repayment government has provided a  discount on interest for the loan which was taken before  being a account i got personal loan easily from them other wise quiet difficult to get a loan from central bank of india my salary credited to this account for the past  only thing is their web site was not user friendly they need improvement in terms of services also last  years back i got personal loan from central bank of india interest rate offered by them was  which is very less compare to hdfc bank they have collected simple documents  from my end being a account holder they did not charged processing fees central bank savings account is fine i am holding this account for  years its a  normal account i am happy with the daily cash withdrawal limit atms are fine at times atms does not work properly  i am able to deposit cash in to the atm machine options are available i have not tried it though overall the central bank of india is average in services incase lan connection fails they will not work very few staff and huge crowd around two to three employees in the branch only two to three employees are there fine for savings account but have to enhance the service provided by central bank of india based on the account maintenance was averagei get average response while i visit the bankthey do have very few atm machines available in the locality and the branches are also few in numbersthe customer service provided was really good net banking facility is good since  years i have been with central bank of india i found it is to be good when ever i drop an email i used to get immediate response from the customer service very normal charges are applied many atm are available so it is good on a whole i had a relationship with the journal officer of central bank of india so i was provided a good service by central bank of india  i use my masterio credit card from last  years  it is sufficient enough with the limit  i get good reward points i used to get discount for my online shoppings etc one dis advantage is emi option is not  available in this credit card it would be better if they provide emi option so that it will be helpful  other wise it a free card my savings account is with central bank of india the services are good they are response when there is a query they have good online services i use it and it is very useful the rate of interest is of  there are no charges at all for this account it is government bank i feel central bank of india is not that good in terms of their customer service so they have to improve their customer service this is only my salaried account their charges are too high for transferring funds etc compared to the other banks the charges should be minimal so that it will be helpful central bank of india savings account is good  they have to improve on their customer service and their features they have to improve on the mobile application they have to launch good customer care  i am holding this account for a period of  years they are providing less service nothing interesting about them my savings account is with central bank of india the services are excellent at the bank they respond very well it is a joint account i hold with them they have offered me the online facility but i have not used them yet they do not taken any charged with regards to the account the interest rate applied was quite highi have got the required amount in the loanthe maximum amount they do provide for home loan is around it was long procedure for getting the loan with this central banki will not recommend about central bank to others central  bank of india net banking is very much secured i have the account with them for two years the minimum amount to maintain is rs  cheque books are given without any charges  atm networks and branches are good customer service is very good initially the minimum balance was  but they have increased to  rupees central bank of india is an nationalized bank but they are rendering good services like government sectors it would be helpful if they understand the customer requirements special features on my visa card interest rate is very less if i pay the payment late if i am a defaulter no charge is applied but big drawback in central bank of india is that no emi option in this card very happy with the offers perhaps the annual charge is  to  the bank can very well introduce the emi options my housing loan is  with central bank of india i am a co applicant there and my father is making the payment the best part is they have waived off the processing fee  they are very much flexible even if we miss to make the pauyemt after a day or so they wont charge any charges central bank of india is a good bank their service is good

have taken my home loan with central bank of india being a government sector bank the process was good but it took some time to disburse the loan they offered me a fixed rate of interest the processing fee was average too the rate of interest is not a constraint for me and the main reason that i took the recurring deposit with the central bank of india for saving the money  years of time

have the  cheque books for the account for the atm card rs is charged yearly once the  atm centers are very rare the bank should improve the net banking as it is not much user friendly and get more atm centers central bank provided me rs  lakhs when i applied for a car loan i am happy with services which they provide the offer is really good and the interest rate is  its a reasonable one the tenure period is  years and it is good that it has part payment options they are fast in responding i got my loan amount in just  days would like to say customer service of central bank of india as good as they are nationalized bank so they are sanctioning educational loan with low interest rate depending on the loan amount the bank is reducing the sanctioning amount infact they are sanctioning

on my salary account but central bank of india is very helpful in the matter of service if we require anything immediately they sort it out to reissue the cheque book they are not charging anything

prompt from them i have a aspire credit card and i already paid a due amount and bank has deducted same amount again in  days the bank branch manager says that we have not responsible for this card

so i got the help from him i am having the savings account with central bank of india for the last  yeari just open this account for getting the  benefits of governmentthe on line bankingother services can be used without any costits the good bank to deal in all aspects thank you for your support its my pleasure to work with you and this site i was new to mumbai and that time i need to open a saving account for my stipend received from my ca firm in mumbai bank bazaar helped me to search about various banks saving account details and from those information i have selected central bank of india which was most suitable to me am highly obelized by your kind support i am holding a savings account with central bank we even help them customer who are uneducated by filling the forms for them and we make their life simpler we issue the debit card and atm card on the spot  if not at least by the end of the day they provide atm visa card  this is the only bank which provides atm cards to minor they also have students account i am holding a fixed deposit with central bank they provide  high interest rate for the staff and for senior citizen it is  as a staff we hardly take  minutes to open the account and provide the receipt it is that simple incase if the customer does not hold an account with us we ask for voters id incase if dont have an account we provide first  through cash and the rest would be transferred to savings account i am holding a rd with central bank they have a scheme called cent milliner scheme where a customer has to deposit about  for a period of  years and after  years it will become  lakhs interest rate offered by them was  flat in case if they are going to withdraw the amount in between they would refund the remaining amount with the interest and principle central bank of india credit card is really good they provide  days grace days this includes service tax as well they provide discounts on  shopping and they dont charge any additional cost if the amount is paid within  days  they cash back on railway ticket booking  mine is a master card and its free of cost central bank overdraft facility is really good when compared with others they are much better interest would be deducted from my salary account customer service offered by them was really good rate of interest offered by them was very less which is   the maximum limit offered by them was  lakhs which for clerical posting  for others its more than  i got the housing loan before  years with central bank of india for  as rate of interestthe tenure period is  yearsits going good till now and i got the loan disbursed within  to  daysi am happy with their services and their approachability i took a car loan from central bank of india i had good experience and the process went on smooth  the paper works were really quick the interest rate offered to me was little competitive  it was around   the charges applied was nil basically  i would like to say that the bank has to improve the quality of the customer service in branch central bank of india is amazing and they had clarified all my doubts in precise i was informed clearly whether i am eligible for home loan and necessary details were communicated to me properly i did not undergo any hurdles as the overall procedure was smooth rate of interest is similar to the market and satisfied with  suggesting central bank of india to keep up the good work infact the house builder had tie up with central bank of india thus i have taken home loan with them my experience was  so good because again it is government bank and for any formalities i have to visit particular branch where my loan was done i recommend this bank only for interest rate because it is less central bank of india is not giving proper response to customers as every time customer have to visit the branch office to get things done fee structure for educational loan are very high as it is above  documentation process was less but the issue is that they are not introducing the government rules immediately where they are very slow on implementing so it should be taken care i have taken a personal loan from central bank of india before  years for my daughters marriage and its been  years completed and i have no issues with them and i also hold my salary account with this bank the customer service executives response is good  if i approach the bank directly the best part about the bank is the rate of interest  charged is less and there is no processing fees as well infact the house builder had tie up with central bank of india thus i have taken home loan with them my experience was not so good because again it is government bank and for any formalities i have to visit particular branch where my loan was done i recommend this bank only for interest rate because it is less i am dealing with cbi cheeka from last  year customer service is very good as compared to other bank and interest rate is at par with other bank net bankig is very good i can make fd through net banking and can close it through net banking also no need to visit branch always as its a nationalized bank i approached central bank of india in avialing home loan it was a user friendly services and everything was taken care smoothly its  interest rate charged this salary account from central bank of india given by my company i dont have any choice online banking was good like balance transfer and earlier it was taking  hours of time to add the beneficiary  they have to improve their services if we call them they always asked to visit office there is no online solution  they are not much advanced like other banks greed authentication system was good greed card data like debit card they will provide and its more  central bank of india is offering personal loan for their customers at moderate rate of interest also they providing internet banking facility which i am very much impressed transaction charges are as per rules so no issues on that glad in holding salary account with them but customer service and response is not good as expected the titanium credit card which i have from central bank is really good the limit they provided was rs the auto debit facility is really good that there are no late payment charges levied there is no annual fees as well there is an offer of rewards points as other credit card the repayment time given is also good i am applied and get succeded in loan loan in central bank of india at nigadi branch i have got loan from them i ahve getting good experience from them  i have saved lot of money on my loan emi due to lowest interest rate so i am personally suggested to go central bank of india for all types of loan i took fixed deposit from central bank of india two years ago and they are giving very good benefits for fd holders but not i could not recall all the things the rate of interest is around  so it is reasonable and good in customer service for tenure of five years i opened fd and they are giving good offers  am holding a fd account with central bank of india which offers an interest rate of  for one year if i had plan of closing that they would deduct  interest and then calculate interest and credit that amount back to my account the only document required for opening this account is pan card and nothing much and overall its been great  post my application for home loan i got call from central bank of india in two days even they are being government organization they changed a lot and they are giving better output central bank of india is working like private sector banks they communicated well and paper works were less  the rate of interest is  and they are prompt in service there is no processing charges central bank of india offers a very impressive interest rate of  fixed overall for  years for home loan they are very much focused on customers needs and not profit oriented overall customer friendly process it would be better if they are flexible in repayment options and also top up loan customer service was quite good from central bank of india  i had one home loan wherein i have decided to transfer the loan to other bank hence i selected central bank of india for my home loan after all searches in website i find their rate of interest was quite affordable than other banks i like the documentation part and they dont have the processing fee charges i amvery comfortable with them central bank of india provided good customer service  they need to improve on their online banking  whenever i used to check my fixed deposit in online it was slow rate of interest was quite competitive  we cant expect too much from them since it was the nationalized bank however they need to improve better customer service initial i have done some deposits in central bank of india for my savings account post which i havent touched it if at all any requirement then only i will be using this account they are improving a lot in their online banking than earlier whenever i transferred funds it was immediately done within quite some time like other banks customer service was quite good from central bank of india  they are not excellent however they are providing normal customer service it would be nice if they had limited clause and conditions for any kinds of queries  whenever i am calling to get an information about my savings account it will resolve at final stage not at initial stage  may be they could improve better nearly  lakh home loan from central bank of india i have cleared after  year from the date i have taken they charged me  of preclosure charges which was already confirmed by them they helped me a lot  rate of interest  was qite affordable when i applied personal loan from central bank of india response was quite good within    days the loan got disbursed i got very good interest rates which was comparatively less than other banks atm and branch facilities are really good central bank of india very nice service is provided by the employees  but the machine in the bank for depositing the cash is very frustrating its almost  mins for every single customer for depositing the cash queue is so long that makes us feel frustrated to stand for long time central bank of india home loan the property which i finalized its already mortgaged with them it was easy to get the loan that was the many reason to get the loan with central bank it was around  days to get loan approval interest rate was  it was normal as other banks they were very supportive with in  days they came and verified the property trusted for almost more than  years my parents have both their accounts in the same bank and its gives us so much facilities that even me and my siblings have opted to choose the same bank for our future use any new offers or new deposits schemes we have always been kept informed which gives us amazing benefits  central bank of india is good comparatively with other banks interest rate and processing fees was lower  interest rate was  and its the fixed interest rate they took  days for documentation verification etc their customer service is good and they are faster in processing and whatever queries i have they are keen on resolving it central bank of india customer service interest rate was all excellent even i had taken the housing loan comparatively with other banks its reasonable rates it was like monthly  i have to pay and dont remember the interest rate returns are good on line i do everything i applied the car loan with central bank of india where to have one nationalised bank relationship with lesser interest rates its still under process  so far i dont have any issues with them in terms of customer service and response overall it was good  it was a great experience of availing a home loan from central bank of india ten years ago i contacted my agent and he helped me out to get the loan we have submitted all the documents to the nearest branch and my loan was approved within a week earlier the rate of interest was around  only but they recently increased to  too nice many services also from this bank user friendly bank is central bank of india

hour to complete the formalities documentation and the process are very clear my loan was approved in a single day and was disbursed on the third day it was a like a very good experience i have availed the home loan from central bank of india in the year  and closed in  it was little bit complicated in availing the loan because so many formalities and so many paperwork obviously central bank of india face lot of problem in disbursing the loans customer service really needs improvement they dont have staff to deal with other areas like mortgage loan housing loan etc major problem was they require one or two guarantors signature rate of interest was very good and they dont charge anything extra central bank of india life insurance the processing and documentation where very simple and

me yet it has been  days still i they did not contacted metheir interest rate is high i felt they have been charging up to  interest rate comparing to other bank yes bank is good and am using the

salary account where i had not been using it for regular transactions the internet banking and mobile banking services of them has been good as well there hasnt been any hassle faced with the banking services of them yes bank has not given me the expected credit limit when i was promised before buying this credit card  i am not received any promotional offers for this card  but the executive has given big hype about having and using this card  there will be huge credit limit and so many offers will be available  i am using the yes bank savings account for the last two to three months where the services of them has been good it has been my salary account where i had not been using it for regular transactions the internet banking and mobile banking services of them has been good as well there hasnt been any hassle faced with the banking services of them yes bank is pretty good in the credit card services the customer support and response is fine and there are no hassles in the process i received the card on time and the credit limit is also good there are annual charges for the card it will get waived off if i use the card for  in a year i recently applied for yes prosperity edge they have not charged me annual fee as it is life time free credit card i am happy with the credit limit which they have given to me it was goodthe reason behind using this card is that i wanted to experience with bank credit card as so far i did not had experience yes bank have changed the bank policy  i am not getting the reward points as they commitment i spoke with the customer care they simply told its based on the bank policy within  days of time after getting the card everything got changed the credit limit is okay for me but the norms should be standard in yes bank they had given me a lesser credit limit of only  k  which is very negligible comparing to my other card  when i purchased a new credit card  there were some reward points were added in my card which is not at all usable in the regular website  they have different vendor to use those reward point  yes bank is my first credit card and it is a  life time free card  now i have so many cards with me  yes bank has given a very little credit limit initially and now they provided a very decent credit limit  yes bank have so many offers and discounts in online  i had applied for a yes bank credit card  they had delivered a different card which i did not opt for the credit limit with the card was very much less than expected which was only  it was a life time free card and since because i was not satisfied with the card i had canceled this card yes bank gave me the only limit of rs i requested them to increase it again i send the pay slip and documents finally they increased to rs  but still its not upto the mark i have yes bank prosperity card it has the life time free benefits i have applied for yes premia bank credit card it was an add on card with they have offers me  the worst part i felt was that they have given me very less limit they have given me up to  which was very very less as per my expectation the verification team blindly bulfing that i will be getting good limit or than  which was very disappointed it is business card despite of that they have given very less limit if they enhance my limit then i will continue this card or else i will be closing this card i got personal loan from yes bank they gave me  of interest for the loan amount of rs  lakhs for the duration of five years the loan documentation was very easy i submitted the physical papers to their end  they support well on the loan process yes bank is good but i am very dis appointed  with the credit limit is not upto the mark they need to increase the limit i got the credit card within fifteen days the document procedure is very good to get the credit card and i got good support from the bank end i got the good support from the yes bank at the time of approving the credit card i never talk to the customer care but they are doing good job the card accessibility is good i can use it any where recently i used the card for fuel filling but the bank gave me only rs limit its not satisfactory the webiste is not user friendly with yes bank it is a salary account i applied for a credit card and the verification call was done for seven to eight times the customer services and response should be more proactive and the call details should be updated in the system the bank is not recommendable i have been applied for yes bank premia credit card recently the reason behind choosing this bank was that i heard they use to give good service but i am not  satisfied with their credit limit like i expected more they have just given me  which was very less i wanted to surrender this card the process of getting card was simple and quick i had selected the  yes prosperity reward plus card  since it is a life time free card and i generally purchase online so that the

getting the card the credit limit with the card is good and there is some good benefits  features with this card i am yet to explore them everything was fine with the yes bank credit card and i am happy with the credit limit  they given the similar credit limit like my other cards  but the only thing  even after changing the card pin  i am not able to use in the off line shopping  at the same time  i didnt contact the customer care people  i am very much fine  with yes credit card interest rate is lesser than other banks but initially they said i would get three times of salary as a limit but they gave me one month of salary limit finally they said will increase the limit after  months of transaction it was not communicated earlier and to open the saving account again they called me they did not inform about the deposit amount finally they asked to deposit rs it was not up to the mark yes bank has given the very lesser credit limit of only  thousand but while purchasing the  card they said they will provide up to one lakh as a credit limit to me  this is completely miscommunication has happened to me  i am going to cancel this card very sooner  yes bank is very good credit

purpose the payment system is easy i did not convert payments into emi so dont know the charges i am banking with yes bank for nearly past  years it is good and salary getting credited with them i have approached for personal loan the interest rate is fine but processing fee was more compared to tata capital the branch experience was good compared to online yes bank is good in the banking services i bank with them for the savings account the online banking is very convenient and it is easy to complete all my transactions with ease i do not have to visit the bank much the customer support is also good i have received a platinum credit card from yes bank the customer service is average it is a life time free credit card the credit limit was medium and got  i have been using the card for more than a month the payment mode is easy and convenient the process in getting this credit card was pretty smooth and they had collected the documents on time the card also had delivered on time the credit limit with the card was quite less than expected and it is a life time free card where they had explained me with the benefits  features as well for the past one year  i am using the yes bank credit card  yes bank offered this card based on my salary account  i am satisfied with the credit limit  it is a life time free card and no hidden charges hoping for more exciting offers in amazon  swiggy for the past two years  i am never okay with the yes bank service in terms of mobile application and atm facilities  most of the times in atm  no proper denominations will not be available and network issue  out of order problem  even mobile application is not easy to handle  the reason for choosing yes bank credit card is for reward pointslike they use to give better points to meand second thing is it is life time free credit card so i have applied for this cardand their credit limit was goodand even documentation part went smooth i am using the salary account with the yes bank the banking process with this bank is very good also there are no charges applicable with this bank but i use the online banking with this bank it is good also it is user friendly to access i am not happy with yes bank credit card i have ask for yes first preferredbut instead of that card they have given me premier cardand they have not told be reason for giving this cardthrough on line i surf i got to know that if any one salary is less than  they use to give premier card  but was completely disappointed mei am not satisfied with this card i have been holding the credit card with the yes bank the credit limit with this card is good also the card has the good offers there is no issues with the billing with this card also it is user friendly card to use the offers with this card is good which is like cash backs and also the rewards points with this card i got my credit card from yes bank on time this is life time free card the bank offers are best even they gave me good limit  pin generation process is very simple but i dont have personal account with yes bank hence paying the amount through online is difficult they should have simple payment gateway i am having my savings account with yes bank for past  years its also good but minimum balance requirement is high the average balance is  and non maintenance charges are also little high the customer service is excellent they are providing unlimited atm transactions i hold international debit card my initial process was good in yes bank for the credit card the bank executive came to my place and took the papers and they send the card within  days the credit limit is satisfactory as per my requirement since its a new card its a life time free credit card its a best thing it has almost been one and a half years since i am using this savings account and the services which they had provided so far has been pretty good there is personal relationship manager to assist us at any point and i had been using this account on a regular basis as well for last  months  i am using the yes bank account as a salary account  very advanced service for the online transaction  user interface is very nice and mobile application very useful and friendly for all the online transaction  a good salary account to use  i am using this credit card for the last two months i am satisfied with the credit limit with the card and i am yet to explore the benefits and features with this card i am not sure whether there is any annual charges with this card and i am yet to use this card as well'"
